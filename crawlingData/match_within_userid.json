As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nReynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.\r\n\r\nAs noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.",

I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.\r\n\r\nSure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick. I did like the cast and characters, all of whom I found suitably interesting. Cate Blanchett is good fun in the lead role, Kevin Hart is perhaps a tad underused but satisfactory nonetheless, while Ariana Greenblatt impresses.\r\n\r\nJack Black is the one I enjoyed most, admittedly that's no surprise given I am a fan of that guy as an actor. I will say that his character is the opposite of Hart's Roland, in that I think the filmmakers should've utilised him less - he does get a bit too much screen time for a side character. However, as it's Black voicing Claptrap I can't possibly say I didn't like seeing him.\r\n\r\n<i>*now looks to see how this has been received thus far*</i> Well, shit.

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",

Overall, comparing the two, they probably level out to be honest, which is actually a good thing when you're talking about a sequel.\r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned about those onscreen, I did still like the performances of Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell - the latter is the best performer, in my opinion. With that said, hopefully Powell can get himself out of this typecast of 'overly cocky guy turns out to be sound' as it's getting a bit tiresome, even though I do really rate him as an actor.",

However, once events leave the arena the movie absolutely bombs its way to the finish. The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.\r\n\r\nThere are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.\r\n\r\nVery surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",

I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.\r\n\r\nPace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.\r\n\r\nAmusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this. Upon exiting, visually I kinda felt like Will Smith in that famous <em>'The Pursuit of Happyness'</em> <em>(which I still haven't seen btw, gotta get on that)</em> crowd scene - only surrounded by women.

                "review": "<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.\r\n\r\nOf the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\r\n\r\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\r\n\r\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",

Maika Monroe puts in a very good showing as Lee, I have zero issues with her performance - she nails it. Alicia Witt merits praise as well.\r\n\r\nThe pacing could've been better, it felt a little longer than its 101 minute run time, but other than that I'd kinda this a success.

I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.\r\n\r\nI'd have finished this franchise with the 2017 flick, but very much sounds like the filmmakers are planning another trilogy with this one.

With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.\r\n\r\nVisually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",

This one is a spin-off and actually loses cast members from the trilogy, which should be a negative as they were the 'best' elements of that series.\r\n\r\nHowever, this cast are good. Kylie Cantrall is a positive addition as Red, as is Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts. Other newcomers who are pluses are Brandy and Malia Baker, Jeremy Swift is decent too. It isn't just the onscreen talent that come out positively, the story and music (no cringe induced, miraculously) are too - they are much improved.\r\n\r\nI am surprised there weren't any major twists (unless they come in a sequel, of course), but that's not a negative. I'm also a fan of how colourful the movie looks, visually it's probably an improvement too.

It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.\r\n\r\nThe needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.\r\n\r\nThe whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.\r\n\r\nCast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.\r\n\r\nMy review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.\r\n\r\nCatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like <em>'Kong: Skull Island'</em> at least...",

On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",

Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.\r\n\r\nOther positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.\r\n\r\nWill check out the sequels, prequels and spin-offs/crossovers with much intrigue.",

Yorgos Lanthimos & Co. evidently did just that and I was thoroughly entertained across the entire run time, which is impressive given it lasts for almost three hours; it flew by for me.\r\n\r\nI'm already a big fan of those onscreen so didn't need much convincing to see them act again, and I'm glad I did because all those acting here are great. Jesse Plemons is the standout in my eyes, what a terrific showing from that man - such a top actor! Emma Stone is, obviously, excellent as well, as is the awesome Willem Dafoe. Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau and Mamoudou Athie merit praise too.\r\n\r\nGotta get <em>'The Favourite'</em> watched at some point, all the while getting set for <em>'Bugonia'</em> - Stone x Lanthimos is where it's at!",

Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.\r\n\r\nThe story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it does overstay its welcome ever so slightly, not for a negative impact but enough that I couldn't rate it any higher.

Well, OK, Scarlett Johansson is good, but there honestly isn't any other element to this that I can say I enjoyed. Johansson's co-star Channing Tatum feels miscast, I like the guy as an actor but here I didn't feel like he fit - visually his character didn't look or sound like someone out of the 1960s, in my eyes at least.\r\n\r\nNone of the support cast did anything for me either, though Woody Harrelson and Ray Romano are passable. Away from the cast, the story also didn't hold much interest for me. I feel like the moon landing bits, generally speaking, is all pretty standard and stuff we've seen before. The romance plot isn't merged in well, I didn't sense any chemistry between Johansson and Tatum. The music is also quite weak, almost TV-esque.\r\n\r\nThe run time is also too long, no way this 2024 flick needed to last over two hours! If I ignore all of that, then I guess I enjoyed it...",

I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\r\n\r\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\r\n\r\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\r\n\r\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing <em>'The Hobbit'</em> films.",

It starts onscreen by describing forthcoming events as \"brutal\", yet by the end I don't really feel like I saw anything all that noteworthy; just your standard horror fare, at best, really.\r\n\r\nMadelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez are good in the lead roles I will say, though some of their character decisions (as is typical with this genre, I guess) are frustratingly dumb; I'm looking at you in particular, Gutierrez's Ryan. Some of their dialogue isn't much better, either. All in all, I'm disappointed as this could've been real great. Instead, we're left with something that I'd personally class as poor, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nChapters 2 + 3 might improve things, let's hope so, but I wouldn't be surprised if this basically just gets rehashed in those next installments, let's hope not in that case.

It's all suitably interesting and held my attention span from beginning to end, but there's just something missing - I can't quite put my finger on what - that stops this 2023 film from being anything above 'good' in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe cast, like the music, are a positive.

B: not as big a slight as you may think, as I didn't dislike that Jared Leto flick as much as most others did (not saying it's good, mind).\r\n\r\nStill, this version of the highly regarded 1994 picture isn't all that, I'm afraid. it almost feels like something completely different, they could've altered a few minor things and made an entirely original film to be honest. I found the pacing to be particularly off, while the antagonist(s) are extremely plain throughout.\r\n\r\nI do have some positives. Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs make for a solid pairing, I sensed enough chemistry between them and both their performances are satisfactory. The music is decent, while some of the kills are creatively done and well shown onsreen.\r\n\r\nAll in all, however, it's a thumbs down from me; no copyright infringement intended, Messrs Siskel and Ebert.",

It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.\r\n\r\nTimothée Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.\r\n\r\nTom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.\r\n\r\nSomeone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).",

However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!\r\n\r\nUnlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!",

From Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) to Héctor (Gael García Bernal) to Ernesto (Benjamin Bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully.

The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.\r\n\r\nThere are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.\r\n\r\nElijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding.\r\n\r\nOverall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. One very much worthy of following <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em>, despite a few 'issues' I have with it.",

The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAway from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. on the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.\r\n\r\nRaver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term *shudder*) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.",

The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\r\n\r\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.\r\n\r\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.\r\n\r\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",

Mark Ruffalo is praiseworthy too, as is everyone else to be honest - e.g. Ramy Youssef and Kathryn Hunter. They all partake in a quite bizarre plot, but one that is absolutely absorbing from beginning to conclusion.\r\n\r\nPre-watch I was somewhat expecting that this was going to be one of those (having not researched anything, as per) overly artsy flicks that I wouldn't connect with, delightfully I was totally wrong.

An unexpected gem!\r\n\r\nI knew nothing pre-watch aside from that it was classed, on Wikipedia at least, as horror, so was simply expecting the usual fare à la <em>'Imaginary'</em> and/or <em>'Immaculate'</em> (former bad, latter good fwiw). Clearly, what I in fact saw knocked my socks off! I had a tremendous amount of fun with every second of this, it's unsettling as it is amusing... every department did a grand job!\r\n\r\nNot even sure where to start with my list of many positives. Alisha Weir is the star of the whole thing, what an utterly brilliant performance from the youngster - so damn convincing, particularly early on. Melissa Barrera is also outstanding, I previously found her fairly forgettable in <em>'Scream'</em> but here I undeniably liked watching her act. Dan Stevens (another I've found 'meh' elsewhere) impresses as well, as does Kathryn Newton. Heck, everyone onscreen is great.\r\n\r\nI love how they showed the bloody (and the blood in general) body implosions, great use of (I assume) practical and special effects - proper thrilled me each time. I was happy to see the film get straight into the plot too, no messing about. It does a good job after that opening portion in setting up the characters before the mess truly hits the fan, which is when the movie seriously clicks into gear. Everything from that point on was an absolute blast - quite literally, eh?!\r\n\r\nGoing back to that opening few scenes, I was actually a touch concerned when it went from the initial fun escape to a one-location dynamic; I thought that was going to slow it down and make it more in keeping with the vibes of those two earlier 2024 movies that I noted at the top of my review. However, each moment in that one location is fantastic to watch, I have zero complaints. It's all paced to perfection!\r\n\r\nAlmost stunned at how much I enjoyed this, probably because I wasn't expecting anything from it. Looking at my ratings I've just now realised that I weirdly haven't got a favourite horror movie. According to the Letterboxd sort, I haven't even rated any films from this genre at anything above 9/10 - and even with that score it's only nine flicks, none of which I strongly adore. An unnoticed blind spot in my taste is evidently no longer.\r\n\r\nThe reviews for this seem generally favourable (at worst), which is nice to see. I've seen many online in agreement with me, what a ride! Not that it needs stating, but I'd highly recommend you check this one out!",

Yeah, that doesn't exactly set the pulses racing! Based on that, I was anticipating it to be a slow-moving set-up to future chapters. However, to my surprise this opening installment is a lot of fun. For a film of such a length, it absolutely flies by; this felt like a 2hr, max, movie to me.\r\n\r\nMy main praise for this film is directed at the pacing (evidently), the visuals and the score - the latter is particularly outstanding. I will say there are a fair few scenes that I felt could've been lit better, mainly across the opening chunk - not a big deal, though.\r\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this, some may say too many but honestly I enjoyed all the different people portrayed onscreen. Kevin Costner is very solid, though to be truthful he isn't really involved all that much in this chapter - at least to how much I was expecting to see of him. I wouldn't say there is a main standout from the cast, but I don't mean that negatively.\r\n\r\nSienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Abbey Lee, Jamie Campbell Bower and Michael Rooker are some of the notable performers, though it truly is an ensemble because I can't really separate any of them based on their performanes - which is actually a good thing. Mind you, as good as he is, Rooker's Irish accent is awful, I gotta say - rather distracting.\r\n\r\nHow annoying that we have to wait so long for the seque... oh, <em>'<em>'Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2'</em>'</em> drops next month! Bring it on!\r\n\r\n...oh, and I (unintentionally) watched this on July 4th - how American of me. *shudders*",

It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio simply never puts an acting foot wrong, this is the sixth film I've seen of his and I love <em>(fwiw: all 9/10+)</em> them all. Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.\r\n\r\nJonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, <em>'Moneyball'</em>. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.\r\n\r\nThe almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive. It doesn't, as I've already mentioned, breed likeability for the characters but I definitely had a fun time watching it all unfold. I guess it depends on what you, as a viewer, prefer. I got the desired amount of entertainment.",

There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.\r\n\r\nStill, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.\r\n\r\nI'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.",

None of the non-battle scenes did anything for me, it's all so heavily forgettable. The added humour/quirkiness from the titular character felt out of place, or at least wasn't blended with the more serious stuff all that well.\r\n\r\nThe long run time, whilst certainly overdone, isn't actually all that much of a hindrance - it's moreso how poorly the run time is utilized.

Now I've done just that, I found the music to be very good - aside from \"Surface Pressure\" (no. 3 in UK), I don't think I'll be listening to any of it on my own time but - more importantly - it's impressively effective for the movie itself. \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" might grow on me, mind.\r\n\r\nThe cast are fun.

The music is also standard, though does improve towards the end with the final score and end credit soundtrack.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a worthwhile watch thanks to Denzel.

That just adds to the fun, they know it's a mindless 78 minutes and make it work.\r\n\r\nThe reason it comes out so well is thanks to David Spade and John Goodman. Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha. Patrick Warburton is also decent as Kronk.\r\n\r\nIt all makes for chilled out viewing, you'll have a good time if you just sit back and enjoy it - as I did.",

Halle Bailey makes for a good Ariel. Daveed Diggs, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy are solid in their respective roles, I'm not wholly convinced by the latter as Ursula but she is still a decent watch. Awkwafina as Scuttle is probably the character I enjoyed most.\r\n\r\nVisually things look nice, I like both the underwater and on firmer ground stuff. Musically it's as good as you'd probably expect, \"Under the Sea\" and, of course, Ariel's songs are solid, while \"The Scuttlebutt\" somehow works more than it probably should. I do think the run time could've been trimmed a touch, but that's not a big deal.",

Particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn't - it actually enhances it. The songs themselves are terrific, with \"Let It Go\" obviously getting the most plaudits.\r\n\r\nIdina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen Bell (Anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while Josh Gad almost steals the show as Olaf - very funny character!

There's also a supposed-to-be cool reveal at the conclusion, yet you can barely see who they are revealing. Very odd choice.\r\n\r\nThe plot and its characters are extremely forgettable, it's just a standard monster(s) attacks small town flick - something we've all seen before. Think <em>'Eight Legged Freaks'</em>, but worse. As for those onscreen, John Ortiz is the standout, though only if I had to pick someone.

The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.\r\n\r\nRachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andrés Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.\r\n\r\nJust a shame about the final act.

I also took notice of Robert Patrick (Jack) and Zooey Deschanel (Ms. Edmunds), but it's very much the Hutcherson/Robb show.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's an endearing film with a pretty creative premise.

I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.\r\n\r\nThere are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.\r\n\r\nThe other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.",

It's much sillier than expected, but in a positive way.\r\n\r\nI do kinda end up wishing they went down a more dark/creative route, instead of relying on the novelty of having scissors as hands; though, to be fair, they do touch on the deeper side a bit. With that said, I did get a good amount of entertainment seeing this plot unfold. It's weird and wonderful.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp is a great actor and is very good here, mainly via his facial expressions and body language. It's cool to see Winona Ryder involved, someone I've thoroughly enjoyed in more recent times in <em>'Stranger Things'</em>. Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall also appear.\r\n\r\nThe film looks neat, as I've come to expect from Tim Burton. It has the obvious touch of Bo Welch to it, with the neighbourhood looking not too dissimilar to what Welch would create for 2003's <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em> - which I, truly, enjoyed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly worth a watch.",

Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.\r\n\r\nThe only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.\r\n\r\nI'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly.

So in that sense, this disappointed. It just has nothing about it, no character or charm whatsoever. No reason to care for any of the onscreen bunch. Very plain.\r\n\r\nNone of the cast stick out, particularly the voices. Megan Fox is probably the best this has to offer, though I didn't mind William Fichtner either... Whoopi Goldberg shows up in an alright minor role too, I guess?\r\n\r\nI found little to zero of the action scenes entertaining, not helped by some questionable editing and music.

Everything about it feels off.\r\n\r\nI was initially a little unsure as to what I thought about <em>'Argylle'</em>, but in the end: it's a no from me. I couldn't actually tell you one thing that I properly liked about this, like at a push Sam Rockwell and Bryan Cranston are decent but even they get a bit hit-and-miss. There's just a constant tinge of lousiness that follows around throughout.\r\n\r\nBryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, even if she is fairly likeable. Henry Cavill is wooden (intentionally? doubtful), as is Dua Lipa but the musician has enough charm to make it work slightly. Speaking of music, all that is used here is alright but again feels off - mostly seems like the correct type of song, just the wrong exact choice of song... \"Electric Energy\" might grow on me, though.\r\n\r\nWhat also doesn't help is the unavoidable feeling that it is a bad redo of <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/kingsman-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingsman</a>'</em>, which is expected given who directed this and all that they are planning with the two flicks behind the scenes. I'm all for a shared universe, though this is perhaps too on the nose. There are also <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Lost City</a>'</em> (itself echoing <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nims-island/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nim's Island</a>'</em>) vibes sprinkled in too. Another negative is the special effects, especially at the start... less said, the better.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it all boils down to being a poor film - unfortunately, as I kinda wanted to like it but simply couldn't. Actually, it's just come to me, I just remembered a scene I actually did truly enjoy: the one with Leona Lewis' \"Run\" track. That was actually entertaining.",

However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.\r\n\r\nBart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments.

If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.\r\n\r\nOnce again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.\r\n\r\nPixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise.

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the <em>'Shrek'</em> franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.\r\n\r\nI do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable.",

The aforementioned is because, as well as the way the film builds in general, I'm pretty certain I watched this at high school; just not sure if it was snippets or the whole thing, the fence scenes are the only ones I vaguely recall seeing.\r\n\r\nThe low acting level of the youngsters did take me out a bit, no dislike to Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, obviously, but they aren't the best. Though they aren't helped by the dialogue for them, which doesn't feel natural at all. It's written in a way that is simply to tell the viewer about what's happening. The adult actors are great, though. Vera Farmiga stands out, though David Thewlis, Rupert Friend and David Hayman merit a mention too.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a good film - and one that is distressingly unforgettable thanks to that one moment.",

                "review": "In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",

                "review": "Recapturing the sparks of brilliance that made a movie a screen classic is a tall order to fill, to be sure. It can be difficult to work the same magic a second time, especially if the first effort was so eminently memorable. And, when the sequel in which that second sought-after lightning strike takes 36 years to come into being, the chances of realizing that level of success once more can be even slimmer. So it is with this long-awaited follow-up to director Tim Burton’s 1988 classic horror spoof, “Beetlejuice.” It’s an offering that, despite some flashes of inspired lunacy, significantly pales by comparison. To begin with, the film gets off to an incredibly dull start; it took me almost 45 minutes before I even cracked a smile (though I’ll admit the humor comes along at a more sustained pace from this point onward). Then there’s the picture’s convoluted plot, which has several story threads that could have easily been pared back, if not eliminated entirely (never mind the fact that this offering’s predecessor suffered somewhat from the same problem, though not nearly to the same degree as here). And then there’s the sometimes-disjointed narrative, which could have used some tidying up in spots, particularly when it comes to the inclusion of bits that work but that don’t seem to bear any meaningful correlation to one another. To its credit, however, the picture features the same stellar production design that distinguished the original, smatterings of raucous humor that genuinely echo the first film, and fine performances by its three principals – Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara – who effectively re-create the iconic characters they portrayed previously. However, many of the new cast members brought on board for this installment (Justin Theroux, Willem Dafoe and Monica Bellucci in particular) add little to the production, serving as disappointing reminders of those who are missing this time around (most notably Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Sylvia Sidney and Glenn Shadix). In many regards, I honestly must admit that this release’s shortcomings don’t surprise me that much, as they’re typical of so many of the other lackluster attempts that have been made at reviving numerous classic movies and television series (though I was hoping that a filmmaking talent as gifted as Tim Burton might defy those odds with this offering). It’s undeniable that a small dose of heartwarming nostalgia can be a pleasant tonic for those who could stand to have their spirits lifted a bit, but don’t expect some kind of miracle cure from this one – the medicine needs to be stronger to accomplish that, and this remedy simply isn’t up to it.",

                "review": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung’s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it’s admittedly rather fun – to a point. With that said, however, there’s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film’s clichéd, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That’s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell’s character is concerned, I’d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, “Twisters” may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less cliché and considerably more originality.",

                "review": "Smart horror films are one movie genre of which not nearly enough offerings are produced. These pictures are proof positive that edgy, spooky stories can be successfully made without having to kill off the cast or engage in spectacles of gratuitous gore. The works of filmmakers like Jordan Peele and Alex Garland exemplify this, as do the three releases in this impressive franchise. And this latest entry is, without a doubt, the best of the lot. “Day One” draws upon the mythology introduced in the series’ first two films, but it takes matters in a new, more insightful direction and does so, ironically, by way of a prequel going back to the origin of this gripping, ongoing saga. What separates this film from what preceded it, however, is that it presents yet another story in the franchise but from an entirely new angle, with new characters, a new setting, and a new, more profound, more nuanced focus. Instead of small-town America, where the first two pictures were set, this offering takes place in New York City, showing what happens when the Big Apple is attacked by the now-familiar aliens that hunt by way of sound as the means for finding their prey – and the measures that surviving humans must take to stay silent to keep from being spotted. The narrative principally follows a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong’o) living in hospice care who has become resigned to the fate of her impending death but now seeks to stay alive at all costs, most notably in helping a frightened Englishman living in Gotham (Joseph Quinn) and protecting her beloved (and adorable) comfort cat. These circumstances give her a new purpose at a time when she might have otherwise completely given up hope. In telling this story, the film also examines the perils of having to suddenly adjust to a “new normal” under unpredictable conditions, as well as the need for all of us to pull together in a united front in the wake of these trying circumstances. But there’s more to it than that, including metaphorical themes and symbolic imagery that truly make this more than just a horror film (and even more than just a smart horror movie at that). While it’s true the story meanders somewhat at times, it nevertheless presents viewers with a thoughtful tale, punctuated by excellent camera work, a fine soundtrack and a superb, award-worthy performance by Nyong’o. Even if you haven’t seen the two previous films in this series or have much interest in this genre, writer-director Michael Sarnoski’s second feature outing is well worth your time. It’s a smart, smart, smart film that rises far above what one might typically expect from a horror flick – and one that will leave you with a lot more than just a few good scares upon exiting the theater.",

                "review": "Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that’s certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker’s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, “Civil War” provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what’s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists’ journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn’t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won’t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that’s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to “get the story,” no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture’s message is one of grave importance, especially in today’s trying, polarized climate. We’d be wise to pay attention to what’s being said in this important work, handily the best – and most troubling – release of 2024 thus far.",

                "review": "According to playwright David Mamet, “Age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.” And, if 93-year-old Thelma Post (June Squibb) has anything to say about it in this fact-based action-comedy-drama, you can take that notion to the bank. In this story of a spry but sometimes-gullible widowed retiree living on her own, we watch – often in jaw-dropping awe – a feisty, independently minded senior determined to get her money back when she’s scammed out of her funds in a phone-based phishing scheme. Thelma says nothing about her plan to her family (Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg), who are already concerned about her ability to continue living on her own, and recruits the assistance of a wily old friend (Richard Roundtree) to join her in her quest to retrieve the stolen cash. The result is an uproarious farce featuring humor that’s clearly outlandish but never implausible or over the top. But there’s more to this offering than laughs – the sight of capable, underestimated elderly folks taking charge over their lives (and, in the case of this picture, even performing their own stunts!) is truly inspiring. This is backed by a potent, poignant (though never preachy) underlying look at what it’s like to grow old and the losses that come with it, a bittersweet meditation on the inevitable changes that come with age and how all too quickly they arrive, material that’s deftly and often philosophically interwoven with the comedy. Director Josh Margolin’s debut feature represents an impressive premiere for the writer-actor, featuring a superbly penned, well-balanced, evenly paced script relating the experiences of his own 103-year-old grandmother, who’s still alive and kicking and whose real-life home was used as one of the film’s principal movie sets. It’s also a triumph for 94-year-old Squibb in her career’s first-ever lead role, one worthy of Oscar contention that effectively depicts a wide-ranging talent that’s been bottled up for far too long. And the film is a fine showcase for Roundtree in his final feature film performance, one in which we see him in a different light from many of his previous roles and in which he’s perfectly matched with his cunning co-star. My only issue with the picture is with the portrayal of Thelma’s family, in which the development of its three principals never comes off quite right, seemingly reaching for something that doesn’t gel properly, an aspect of the narrative that clearly could have used some further refinement. Otherwise, though, “Thelma” (or “Thelmaf” as it was known in an alternate version of the title) is one of the funniest, best produced releases that I’ve seen in quite some time. So hop on your scooter and get your behind to see this one – or else.",

                "review": "I’m going to say up front that this is a film I’m probably going to be processing for quite some time. The latest offering from writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos – best known for films like “The Lobster” (2015), “The Favourite” (2018) and “Poor Things” (2023) – is as much a puzzle as anything else. Told in three loosely interlaced stories with mostly the same cast members playing different roles in each, the film primarily deals in explorations of control and abuse examined from various angles. The individual stories plumb an array of additional subjects, including life, death, sanity, religion, cult membership, sexuality, dreams, surreality and self-indulgence, among others, most of which are tinged with exceedingly dark, macabre, cynical, satirical humor (evident even in its title) very much in the same vein as one of the filmmaker’s other, more troubling releases, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017). Unlike that mess of a picture, though, “Kinds of Kindness” is somewhat more coherently structured, both in its individual segments and overall, even though the finished product still has an overly cryptic eccentricity that could have benefitted from better delineated refinement. To be sure, “Kindness” has its strong points, such as its sardonic humor that may often have you giggling at things that you probably think you shouldn’t be laughing at. It also has strong performances from many of Lanthimos’s regulars, including Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, along with newcomers Hong Chau and Jesse Plemons, winner of the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor Award (though I can’t help but wonder what effect this film may have on the future of their careers, talent notwithstanding). And, much to my surprise, the pacing is fairly well sustained for a movie with a 2:45:00 runtime, probably because it holds viewer attention well, leaving audiences perpetually wondering where each of the vignettes is going next. On the downside, however, its graphic imagery, explicit sexuality, extreme violence and other questionable story elements may easily turn off some members (myself included at times), particularly when they push the limits of acceptability (sensitive viewers take note, especially animal lovers). So the bottom line questions here would be, “Did I like it?” and “Would I recommend it?” Well, that depends on how open one is to edgy content that clearly pushes the envelope. To be honest, there are things about this offering that I truly liked, but, then, my tastes tend to be more open-ended than those of many more conventional moviegoers. Because of that, however, this may consequently be seen as the kind of picture that many of those same audience members might find unduly troubling and offensive, readily labeling it as such and claiming that this is the sort of movie that gives many reviewers a bad name (and they probably wouldn’t be entirely wrong in saying that). Lanthimos has certainly pushed limits in many of his previous works, such as “Poor Things,” “The Lobster” and “The Favourite,” but the edginess of those releases had a playful, warmer, more whimsical feel to them than this outing, which is much more akin to the disturbing shadowiness of a film like “Sacred Deer.” Keep all of the foregoing in mind if you’re contemplating a screening of this one. And, in any event, if you come away from it outraged, disappointed or confused, don’t say you weren’t warned.",

Writer-director Nia DaCosta’s third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn’t have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren’t adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren’t explained at all, leaving viewers who aren’t comic book laureates wondering what’s going on (particularly at film’s end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn’t particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture’s pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that’s growing tiresome in the studio’s releases, a development akin to the “Paul is dead” legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there’s the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they’ve been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, “The Marvels” is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that’s troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren’t to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they’re cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like “Wakanda Forever” (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work – and it’s time to show viewers that.",

Those are among the possibilities raised in the latest hair-raising smart horror/comedy from the writing-directing duo of Cameron and Colin Cairnes. This documentary-style offering presents the supposedly lost recording (complete with allegedly never-before-seen found footage) of a 1970s late night talk show hosted by comedian/TV personality Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) whose goal is to unseat Johnny Carson’s eminently popular Tonight Show as the premier after-hours choice of viewing. Delroy’s Night Owls broadcast is modestly successful, but it never manages to win the late night ratings race, so he desperately looks for ways to nudge his program over the top. When he decides to host a Halloween show with an array of occult/paranormal guests – capitalizing on a growing trend at the time – he believes he’s hit on the formula to achieve his goal. But, as the show progresses, he finds himself in over his head as events begin to spiral out of control. Viewers both on and off the screen are kept in suspense with a well-integrated blend of humor, high camp and unexpectedly spooky moments involving a hammy, self-righteous psychic medium (Fayssal Bazzi), an egomanical magician-turned-debunker (Ian Bliss), and an escaped teenage cult member (Ingrid Torelli) and her psychologist caregiver/surrogate parent (Laura Gordon). As things deteriorate, Jack tries to hold the show together with the aid of his producer (Josh Quong Tart) and flunky sidekick (Rhys Auteri). But, as the stakes are continually upped, that task grows ever more difficult, especially when supernatural influences begin to assert themselves in the studio, threatening both the broadcast and the fulfillment of the host’s long-cherished dream. Although occasional pacing issues, a periodically disjointed narrative and a somewhat overblown final act can get in the way of the smoothness of the story flow, these shortcomings are made up for by the film’s superb period piece production design, its clever writing and its fine performances, most notably that of the protagonist. And, in the end, it’s all served up with lots of laughs and a tidy moral of the story. Admittedly, “Late Night with the Devil” probably would have worked better as a Halloween release than a piece of springtime movie fare, but that doesn’t lessen the entertainment value of this inspired production, one thar shows horror flicks can indeed do more than just see how high it can make the final body count.",

Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",

                "review": "When the circumstances of our lives don’t suit us, it’s time to reinvent ourselves – something that happens both literally and metaphorically in this latest offering from director Yorgos Lanthimos. But the way that result comes about here represents a truly inspired fusion of genres, including comedy, romance, social commentary and sci-fi, making for one of the most inventive, unusual and hilarious releases of recent years. This offbeat feminist fable tells the story of how a pregnant, young, anonymous suicide victim (Emma Stone) is reanimated with the aid of a brain transplant from her unborn fetus, an achievement accomplished by a colorful, controversial but well-meaning surgeon/scientist a la Dr. Frankenstein (Willem Dafoe). He nurtures his subject back to life, health and sentience, a sometimes-challenging process that finally surfaces when she discovers sexuality, the trigger for exploring a new, independent life for herself, both physically and emotionally. Through a series of adventures over the course of a trip through Europe with a free-wheeling, lusty but lecherous, self-serving lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), she finds herself as a self-actualized woman in an age where that’s more of a rarity than a standard, particularly in a world where men treat women more like property than people. While the film’s pacing could use some shoring up in the middle, this offering nevertheless entertains with uproarious laughs throughout, even when the narrative turns more thoughtful and substantive. The superb performances by Stone, Dafoe and Ruffalo are top shelf, contributing to the picture’s whopping 13 Critics Choice Award and 7 Golden Globe Award nominations. The film is also visually stunning in its cinematography and editing, as well as in its spectacular and whimsical production design, filled with images reminiscent of the movies of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam while sustaining a look all its own. Admittedly, this release features a good deal of explicit sexuality, both visually and in the dialogue, so sensitive viewers should take note. However, as one of the most anticipated pictures of this year’s awards season, “Poor Things” never disappoints, serving up a solid offering that consistently tickles the funny bone while giving audiences much to think about – and there’s nothing poor in any of that.",

                "review": "In the interest of full disclosure, I’m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word “part” in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie’s latest has a lot going for it – an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise’s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one’s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture’s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of “Dead Reckoning” might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging “part” problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We’ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can’t exactly say I’m holding my breath about it.",

                "review": "Providing care, comfort and compassion to the world’s downtrodden is undoubtedly a noble, if exhausting and often-frustrating, cause, especially when pleas for help go ignored or fall on deaf ears. Yet, every so often, someone comes along who tirelessly keeps on fighting for those less fortunate, as was the case with Italian immigrant Mother Francesca Cabrini (Cristiana Dell’Anna). Upon her arrival in New York in 1889, the diminutive but zealous nun from Lombardy set about her work to care for her fellow countrymen and women (especially orphaned and abandoned children) in desperate need of food, housing and medical care, the first charitable undertaking of what she envisioned becoming a worldwide network of such ventures. She successfully raised awareness of the plight of these emigrees by getting the attention of a New York Times reporter (Jeremy Bobb), an endeavor that garnered support for her efforts and challenged the prejudicial attitudes of the public and New York’s municipal government, including its bigoted, intolerant mayor (John Lithgow). And, through it all, she wrestled with personal health issues that hung over her for many years. Writer-director Alejandro Monteverde’s latest presents a detailed, well-told biography of a woman who wouldn’t give up at a time when the deck was stacked against her, both on the bases of her gender and nationality, as well as (in some cases) as a representative of the Church. The picture’s superb production design, fine period piece production values and gorgeous cinematography lend much to this release, as do the performances of Dell’Anna and Lithgow, along with a host of supporting characters. Despite these strengths, though, this slightly overlong offering has occasional problems with pacing, monodimensional character development, overdramatic elements (particularly in the soundtrack) and an underdeveloped back story. At the same time, however, “Cabrini” tells an inspiring and uplifting tale of someone who accomplished a lot but hasn’t really received the attention she’s due. This film helps to make up for that oversight while reminding us all that we can play a part in fulfilling her dream of genuinely creating an empire of hope for the world.",

                "review": "How disappointing it is when you see a movie that you were looking forward to only to walk away unimpressed, if not largely disappointed. So it is with director Pamela Adlon’s debut feature, a comedy-drama about the wild and crazy relationship between two lifelong thirtysomething New York BFFs (Ilana Glazer, Michelle Buteau) who share the experiences of pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood while struggling to maintain the kind of free-spirited friendship they had before becoming mothers. The narrative consists of a series of vignettes – some outrageous, some touching, some serious – involving various aspects of their connection, their individual lives and their interactions with others. Unfortunately, these episodes are wildly inconsistent, regardless of their nature. Some work well (especially, surprisingly enough, those that get unapologetically down and dirty with unbridled raunchy humor), but most others fall stunningly flat for a variety of reasons. The biggest problem here is the writing, which frequently tries far too hard to make the material work. Some segments simply aren’t funny, relying on excessive exhausting mugging and overacting to win over audience members and unsuccessfully persuade them otherwise. Others are utterly preposterous and implausible (despite trying to come across as “zany” or “outrageous”), lacking credibility in terms of plot devices, character development and story flow. And others still are just plain inauthentic, particularly when driven by the strained chemistry between the two often-immature leads, whose supposed bond simply isn’t convincing. What’s more, when the film unsuccessfully tries to turn serious, scenes that are supposed to move and touch viewers don’t work, because the film doesn’t do enough to engender sufficient interest in the protagonists, their challenges or their relationship with one another. To its credit, the film features some fine performances by supporting cast members (John Carroll Lynch, Stephan James, Elena Ouspenskaia), but the leads grow progressively tiresome, especially the longer the movie drones on. In short, “Babes” is a big misfire that fails to deliver despite a few modest laughs along the way. Best bet for this one? Wait for it to come to streaming.",

                "review": "It’s disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn’s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that’s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, “So what’s it going to be?” There’s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we’ve already seen before in movies like “Romancing the Stone” (1984), “The Long Kiss Goodnight” (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it’s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there’s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there’s the picture’s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. “Argylle” also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn’t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what’s conveyed in the picture’s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn’t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. “Argylle” apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we’ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.",

Thing is, she's already been rescued by \"Roland\" (Kevin Hart) and is in no great rush to return to the loving arms of daddy. Whilst trying to track her down, \"Lilith\" encounters the true star of the film - the robot \"Claptrap\", a sarcastic pile of scrap who decides to help out whether she likes it or not, so off they go a-child-hunting. Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers.

This story starts with a battle that sees control pass from \"Jim\" to \"Cyclone\" (Louis Koo). There's now a truce of sorts that exists between the bosses and the outside world, but that's about to be thrown into turmoil by the arrival of \"Lok\" (Raymond Lam). He works hard to get an official ID card but is fleeced by \"Mr. Big\" (Sammo Hung) and escapes with a bag of his cocaine into the walled city.

The focus of his revenge is that man's own son - but nobody nows what happened to him. Well, swiftly you can add two and two and get \"Lok\". Loyalties are now tested, friendships challenged and forged whilst the fragile peace is soon in tatters. With battle lines drawn and ambitions clear, it's all out war and the action mounts up. This is a sold end-to-end martial arts film with plenty of nimble and lithe combat; acrobatics and bodies that must be made of skin-clad tungsten steel. It's got a little bit of mysticism and embodies human nature, whether benign or not, quite entertainingly and by not just throwing itself about, but by at least trying to create and develop the characters. The denouement takes it's time and does become a bit repetitive, but as a quickly paced drama it really does fly by for two hours.

Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

Another of her erstwhile coleagues, \"Javi\" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters \"Tyler\" (Glen Powell) - he's a \"tornado wrangler\" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing.",

As the name suggests, he's a brutal serial-chopper whom they know is at the concert. With the net tightening, we begin realise quickly who the identity of the murderer is and so now have to sit through an increasingly preposterous hundred minutes of cat and mouse with Hayley Mills hoping to catch her man. At times this does generate a bit of menace as he sees the openings to flee being systematically closed in front of him, and with his enthusiastic daughter in tow, his options are increasingly limited but in the end it's all peters out into a rather ridiculous ending that I found rather weak, implausible and disappointingly unoriginal. Hartnett just hasn't the manner to convince as the baddie and there's way too much concert-style material that suggests Miss Shyamalan asked her dad if she could have a film for Christmas.

Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon \"Ryle\" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's \"Allysa\" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with \"Atlas\" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When \"Ryle\" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might to become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of \"Lily\" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama.

Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",

That was pretty much the gist of their plan until they discover that the wealthy \"Baldeo\" (Harsh Chhaya) is travelling with his family. Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader \"Fani\" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter \"Tulika\" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando \"Amrit\", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective. With his colleague \"Viresh\" (Abhishek Chauhan) travelling with him, and with the help of one or two courageous passengers, the two soldiers are hopelessly outnumbered, but hugely inventive. This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West.",

In this, admittedly the story is all pretty thin, but his characterisation has a friendliness to it that I found quite enjoyable. \"Harold\" is the human manifestation of a fellow who lives quite happily in the land of fiction, but who arrives in the real world to try and find his creator \"the old man\". Together with his more reluctant pal \"Moose\" (Lil Rel Howery) he starts approaching old gents in the park - and yes, well that just causes pain. Then he encounters the young \"Mel\" (Benjamin Bottani) and his mum \"Terry\" (Zooey Deschanel) after she hits him with her car. An overnight at their home sees the start of a rather daft bonding exercise that's completely devoid of jeopardy but thanks to the odd intervention from fantasy-obsessed librarian \"Gary\" (Jermaine Clement) and his straggling pal \"Porcupine\" (Tanya Reynolds) is quite fun. There's an innocence to the whole thing that is quite touchingly simple and honest. People with invisible friends - didn't we all? The animation is perfectly adequate and the purple crayon could teach a 3D printer a thing or two about creating an aeroplane or a car tyre. Sure, it's all forgettable fayre and I'm not too sure if it's in any way sophisticated enough for today's kids - but it's generally quite an entertaining vehicle for a star who looks every inch in his element. It's a summer movie that's as good as any of the more hyped animation's I've seen so far in 2024.",

Luckily, there are no cigars to be seen as his Presidential visage looks down on FBI agent \"Carter\" (Blair Underwood). He's in charge of an investigation looking into the slaughter of entire families in their homes. There's no evidence of any third party anywhere, with the father invariably found having killed himself after slaughtering just about everyone else. Thing is, fellow agent \"Harker\" (Maika Monroe) thinks that there's way more to it than that. She's got a sort of sixth sense when it comes to these things and soon she and \"Carter\" are on the trail of the eponymous character (the sparingly used but effective Nicolas Cage) who may - or may not - be the source of some cryptic messages left near the site of each atrocity. Central to her theories are some eerily looking dolls. There are child size, perfectly made with porcelain and contain mysterious aluminium spheres. What's the purpose of them? It turns out that \"Harker\" might be able to elicit some answers from her mother \"Ruth\" (Alicia Witt). She's not quite the full shilling but as the detective recalls an encounter with a stranger many years earlier, we begin to wonder if mum might be more involved... It's quirky this story with elements that make sense and others that dart about making it almost impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom nor, more importantly, why? The rather brutal denouement does let it down. It's rushed and serves to fill in years worth of intrigue with five minutes of dialogue - indeed, I couldn't help but wonder if a sequel was in the offing as the story wrapped all too abruptly. Monroe delivers well here, as does photographer Andres Arochi who helps create an almost claustrophobic atmosphere to add quite a bit of tension to the plot. It's not especially scary, but it takes a different approach to creating horror for the mind rather thanks the eyes - and it works quite well.",

Initially reluctant, she agrees to walk with him and gradually a bond develops as the environment gradually and dangerously disintegrates before them. Luckily, the monsters can't swim - so perhaps they can try to make it to the water? Obviously there's not a great deal of dialogue here, so the accumulating sense of (limited) menace is built by two actors who are adequate but who don't really have enough to work with to make this stand out. As ever, the lengths people will go to to save their pets astonishes me. Danger everywhere and yet both feel the need to risk life and limb for a moggy! Bizarre. It's difficult at the best of times to get much traction from prequels, and Michael Sarnoski doesn't really manage to develop the characters or the story beyond this ninety minutes of stand alone cinema that really has little to do with the other, far better, films from earlier in this strand.

There are some beautiful animals featured in this film and the Californian Vasquez Rocks National Park serves well enough as a location double, but the rest of this is all really quite poorly written and executed before a denouement that I could have done with half an hour earlier.

Maybe he thought it was called \"Pray\" instead?

Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from \"Caesar\" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of \"Proximus\" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault.

It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",

Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of \"Smeg\", \"Rictus Erectus\" and \"Scrotus\" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore.

Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with \"Kong\" ruling the roost deep in \"Hollow Earth\"; \"Godzilla\" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and \"Ilene\" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled \"Jia\" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for \"Monarch\" and mankind. \"Kong\" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, \"Trapper\" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. \"Godzilla\" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by \"Kong\" and his human pals. With \"Bernie\" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why \"Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times \"Kong\" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from \"Jurassic Park\" to episodes of \"Stargate\". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",

California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of \"Falling Skies\" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",

I would say you couldn't make it up, but clearly the series-prone author Mercedes Ron did in her novel. Amazon have early thrown some cash at this, but little of it was spent on the screenplay and the acting - well Wallace reminded me a little of Shailene Woodley but \"Nick\" is just an overblown drip - with or without his clothes.

Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy.

It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",

Recruiting her pal \"Ben\" (Richard Roundtree) - or, more accurately, car-napping his mobility scooter, she escapes from the protective custody of her family and sets off to find the culprit.

I thought Hechinger tried a bit too hard here, but there is still something enjoyable about his at times rather theatrical performance and his dynamic with the charming and formidably ingenious Squibb. Clark Gregg and Parker Posey make up the rest of the family and quite entertainingly shine a light on the problems of parents dealing with an elderly relative - about whom they do, genuinely, care, whilst also trying to live their own lives and keep an eye on a son who has, just to make matters slightly worse, recently split from the love of his life. It does have a bit of a wobble for ten minutes towards the end as it struggles a little to make a point about the stupidity of the bloody-minded but for the most part there's a good deal to giggle at as the pair go along.

There's really nothing at all to recommend this to anyone. It's not original, nor is it funny.

The first (my favourite) sees Plemons as \"Robert\". He is an outwardly professional man who lives with is wife \"Sarah\" (Hong Chau) and works for \"Raymond\" (Dafoe). He has just recovered from a very slight car accident - and on meeting with his boss we discover a little more of just what that was about and of the somewhat curious nature, and dependencies, of their relationship. The second didn't engage with me so well as cop Plemons is \"Daniel\" struggling to deal with the loss of his wife \"Liz\" at sea. When she turns up somewhat unexpectedly, she appears completely different somehow and some fairly ghastly sacrifices are soon necessary before anyone can see any light at the end of this emotional maelstrom of a tunnel. Finally, the two share the leads more looking for the ideal candidate for a cult run by \"Omi\" (Dafoe). Candidate for what? Well so long as she is the right weight and her breasts are equidistant from each other and her navel, then it'd doesn't seem to matter... Thing is, she has an estranged husband (Joe Alwyn) and a daughter who are keen to have her back - and he is prepared to use some fairly ghastly methods to see she is \"contaminated\". The scenarios are quite hard to describe. They are surreal in places, brutal in others - but I found rarely entertaining. We are presented with the façades of characterisations but it's the questions their escapades pose to us that is more interesting. What might we do to satiate our cravings for love, affection and a sense of feeling needed? How easily led we can be. The things a person will do for a tennis racket smashed by John McEnroe in 1984! It's not that it blurs lines of sexuality. There aren't any. It's sexually fluid and frequently presents us with an environment where people behave according to instinct and not societal morals. Dafoe takes the acting plaudits for me, his ownership of his roles is unnervingly creepy at times. Stone, though, seems to be resurrecting her \"Pretty Little Things\" (2023) style of characteristic (lots of racing around taking short steps) and Plemons is adequate enough, but somewhat just a little too anodyne with roles that ought to have taken us more by the scruff of the neck. It also didn't really resonate with me as a comedy either. I could see where the humourous elements were supposed to be but I prefer my humour more subtle - these punches just didn't land well enough.

It all starts with \"Optimus Primal\" (aka. \"Kingus Kongus\") having a fight with the all-consuming \"Unicron\" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker \"Noah\" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother \"Kris\" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. \"Noah\" turns to crime and that's where he encounters the newly invigorated \"Autobots\" who have realised that \"Elena\" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the \"Maximals\" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we've been through loads of episodes of \"Stargate\" as well \"King Kong\" (probably the Peter Jackson one), \"The Goblet of Fire\"; \"Independence Day\", \"Star Trek\" (JJ Abrams version), all four \"Indiana Jones\" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle \"Airazor\" reminded me of a hairier version of \"Bubo\" from \"Clash of the Titans\". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it's got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times! There's no jeopardy at all, really, and given that \"Optimus Prime\" - maybe he ought to be called \"Hopeless Prime\" because he is pretty useless in a fight - gets to make his grand speech at the end, I'm sure there will be more for our intrepid young \"Noah\" to come. Big screen essential - this will look bland and repetitive on the telly. Maybe it'll help sell some toys?",

The story is beyond simple and the game-based animation - though expertly crafted - did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations, thrill or much sense of adventure. I got the feeling this was really an outing for \"Mario\", \"Luigi\" and \"Peach\" designed to satisfy the die-hard fans, or the children - or both, but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungi-fest. It wouldn't be fair to say this is bland - it's not designed to challenge or take risks: it's fun for those who grew up with \"Mario\" et al in their lives and I'm not going to decry that. It's colourful, pacy, and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it?",

                "review": "This does suffer a bit from having been trailed to death in the cinema, and the story is really pretty thin - but there's some engaging chemistry on display between the two stars as their adventures hot up. \"Colt\" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero \"Tom Ryder\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director \"Jody\" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives \"Colt\" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer \"Gail\" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that \"Jody\" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what \"Gail\" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, \"Ryder\" is a bit flaky - but all \"Colt\" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex. A good soundtrack helps it all along and though I doubt I'll recall much about this in three months, it's a lively poke at the characters that make movies and I quite enjoyed it.",

This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar®️ suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor \"James Bond\" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting \"thwack\" and \"pow\" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.",

It appears that her new powers connect her to \"Danvers\" (Brie Larson) and her slightly estranged cohort \"Rambeau\" (Teyonah Parris). When they use their powers they find themselves transported into each other's shoes - causing mayhem all over the place, especially at the family home of the rookie superhero who is as yet unaware of just quite how powerful her shiny amulet is. \"Dar-Benn\" is out for revenge. After \"Danvers\" destroyed the AI that controlled their planet, it has gone into terminal decay and so she decides to reinstate her world by stealing the atmosphere from one world, then the water from another - where they only speak in song, so perhaps no great loss - before deciding to borrow the sun from Earth to reinvigorate their own failing star. With a little help from \"Nick Fury\" (Samuel L. Jackson) the three have to galvanise their powers and focus on thwarting this dastardly design before it's too late. Now there is nothing even remotely original in this. It's all join the dots Marvel adventure with the usual pyrotechnics, spectacular visual effects and thinnest of stories. The denouement is never in doubt and actually feels rather rushed after a first half hour of repetitive combat scenes that don't draw breath but don't really entertain either. Larson is a natural actor (she reminds me a lot of Grace Kelly) but nobody here really has much by way of dialogue to work with as we see this film manoeuvred into the path of another franchise that it would appear destined to join with next time. Barbra Streisand makes a surprise (vocal) appearance during quite an innovative scene herding cats and simultaneously saving people, but I found the rest of this to be same old, same old and though shorter than we are used to, it's still all a bit old hat.

So far, it's a bit like \"Mr & Mrs Smith\" as neither parent knows of the perilous activities of the other.

Now the story rather turns into \"Sky Captain\" (2004) and their search for the ingredients of their cake - and his secret mission - takes them into the skies and into a series of combative escapades that sees bullets, bombs and even experimental guided missiles flying about all over the place. I'd never heard of the original television series and was a little reluctant to see this in a cinema as so often these films just build on characters about whom I know little. That's not the case here. This is a solid stand-alone story that doesn't require prior knowledge of anyone to get into it, and that serves it well. The animation is quickly paced and each character (even the dog) has a role to play as the adventure hots up. The plot is not exactly original, no, but there's some fun to be had as these characters deliver an adventure that avoids repetitive combat scenes and after a slow start is well worth a cinema outing.",

The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you’d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey’s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it’s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there’s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole “multiverse” theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I’m not sure I’ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for “Miles” and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",

Whilst this is all going on for \"Maxine Minx\", there is a serial killer on the loose in Los Angeles and the police seem to think that maybe she is involved. Obviously she's not the perpetrator of these vicious acts, but might she somehow be the ultimate target?

At times this is quite an attitudinal film and Goth does fine, but (no pun intended) Bacon just hams it up too much. Debicki seems totally disinterested in her role and the rest of the cast add very little to a story that is too thinly stretched to pad out one hundred minutes before taking us to a rather weak and rushed denouement.

Thing is, with the Vietnam war in full swing the public have rather lost interest in the space race with the USSR. Presidential adviser \"Moe\" (Woody Harrelson) hits on the idea of bringing in marketing specialist \"Kelly\" (Scarlett Johansson) to spruce things up and get the public - and the US Senate - more engaged with the project before it runs out of money and impetus. She's pushy and brassy and \"Cole\" hates her! Thing is, though, he also starts to realise that she's not half bad at the hoodwinking game and seems to be making some headway engaging sponsors and senators alike with the aspirations of Messrs. Armstrong and Aldrin to set foot in the Sea of Tranquility. With public interest piqued, \"Moe\" realises that the last thing they need is a flop, so he tells \"Kelly\" to create a moonscape and get in her favourite director - \"Lance Vespertine\" (Jim Rash doing his best Stanley Tucci) to essentially make their own, terrestrial, version of the landings that can be shown to the public should the worst case scenario actually occur. With her and \"Cole\" becoming closer and the launch date now imminent, it's soon clear that this isn't just a contingency plan - and that might finally present the unflappable \"Kelly\" with a moral dilemma she can't easily shrug off. What to do? It's quite entertaining, this, with Johansson clearly enjoying herself playing a myriad of parts within her character and there's a decent spark with the better than usual Tatum as the story swipes at politics (largely thanks to a playfully devious effort from Harrelson) and advertising whilst we learn that she is not quite the woman she seems to be. At times the writing is quite funny and the whole thing offers lunar conspiracy theorists (and the disbelieving Soviets) the perfect opportunity for the mother of wet dreams. There's plenty of rocket photography and though maybe just twenty minutes too long, this is one of Apple's better and more creative efforts.

Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson validate the best in the casting director's art as we set off on this wonderfully enjoyable fantasy adventure. The supporting cast - Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Zoë Wanamaker et al all add richness to this as young \"Mr. Potter\" and is friends begin to realise their magical potential. John Williams works his wonders creating a score almost as recognisable as his \"Star Wars\" theme and the special effects are gentle, yet sophisticated.

Hey, but wait - there's a submarine hatch in the floor, and when they go down they discover a lot more about who their enemy are, what they want and just who built this equivalent of a nuclear fall out shelter under the trees. Can they use this information to escape the trap and make it to freedom? At times it is quite menacing with their dark and wooded surroundings adding a degree of malevolence to an antagonist that we never really see and whose Gaelic mythological provenance is disappointingly undercooked. It has a go at ending a few times, but then comes back to add a little more to signal what I thought was that there'll be a sequel along shortly, rather than finish the adventure completely.

Then he and producer \"Leo\" (Josh Quong Tart) come up with an idea for a riveting Halloween special. The gist of what comes now purports to be an off-air recording of that lost transmission from 1977 - and it's quite literally hair raising. His first guest is a medium, his second an out-and-out sceptic and his third - well they have quite an unique claim to fame - and it's this last quarter of the film that comes \"alive\". Sadly, the rest of this feature is rather hampered by the constant (virtual) advertising breaks that completely suck the pace out of the thing. They are designed to, in monochrome, fill in a little of the back-stage machinations as the programme goes to air but for me, they just interrupted - far too frequently - the culmination of the truth or fake storyline. Dastmalchian does an half decent job here, but the plaudits really belong to Ian Bliss and his sarcastic \"Carmichael Haig\" character. He's the poacher-cum-gamekeeper cynic who has a ridiculing put down for just about everything that emanates from the other characters. Projectile vomiting or chair levitation - he has an plausible explanation. That's maybe part of the film's problem in general. Though set in the 1970s when these kind of visual effects were less prevalent, the whole thing just comes across as a perfectly plausible ratings-gathering gimmick. Whilst that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does rather rob the film of any pretence of horror or mystery. In fact, by the conclusion it seemed more designed to send up the whole principle of half-baked, late-night American television hosted by vain, ambitious but largely talentless men in suits. It's short and sweet, and doesn't hang around - but I just didn't find it particularly shocking or innovative. Wait til it's on the television, I'd say.",

Sadly, though, the story swiftly goes way off the rails and leaves us exposed to Sweeney's limited talents and an excess of hysteria that involves a chicken, a dimly lit catacomb and a dastardly plan that puts enormous strain on our increasingly inventive and resilient novice. As \"Yoda\" might have profoundly said, \"loads of screaming and ketchup do not an horror film make\" and after about half an hour here the writing is on the wall (perhaps the best place for it?) and my interest wained.

                "review": "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",

He was a kamikaze pilot towards the end of WWII who feigned some technical problems with his plane and so landed and survived! Now, Japan is defeated and in ruins and he is feels a deep sense if shame. He manages to find a job in a wooden-hulled boat trying to collect up from the sea all the mines laid by the Allies and the Japanese alike, and it's whilst they are at sea they discover a toxic creature that has been born out of the ashes of the atom bomb. This creature is bent on destruction and nothing mankind has in it's arsenal can even dent this leviathan that possesses a deadly blue ray than can obliterate all in it's path. It heads to the land wreaking devastation and so the scientists must come up with a plan before the country is laid waste. It's really two stories. One of the man with all of his demons, his burgeoning romance with a homeless girl and her child and of his gradual realisation that maybe his life isn't quite over yet. The remainder is the standard \"Godzilla\" style special effects fest that I must admit to preferring to the more recent Hollywood versions. The style of animation here is grittier, the monster knobblier and angrier and the immediately post-war timeframe allows the photography to present us with a more attractively bleak film to look at. The ending is predictable, sure, but at least it tries to solve the problem of this marauding beastie in a little more of an innovatory fashion. Not much original here, but I still quite enjoyed it.",

She's heading to start a new job as an architect, and it looks like she might have been responsible for manscaping her boyfriend's perfect visage as this annoyingly loved up and clingy couple arrive at a remote rural diner.

They're famished so he borrows a motor bike to go fetch some burgers, she's left behind and that's where the paranoia sets in. Is she being watched? Is she alone? Will \"Ryan\" get back before she has finished smoking a dodgy joint, listening to an entire LP and having a long shower? Was the burger joint in California? Anyway, it's soon clear that they are in some danger and together they must use all their skill and guile to stay alive! The scenario works a bit like \"Cabin in the Woods\". The moonlit forest serving as a backdrop for some ridiculous choices and some woefully bad acting/writing.

                "review": "Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the \"Manhattan Project\" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious \"Col. Groves\" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event \"enquiries\" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",

His cat is a sort of combination of Cyrano de Bergerac and Casanova - full of flair, dashing and adept with his flourishing blade. Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters \"Perrito\" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little \"Jack Horner\" and \"Goldilocks\" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival \"Kitty\" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the \"Goldilocks\" story and try as I might, I just couldn't remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It's pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn't really improved much since \"Evita\" (1996). It's a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can. Maybe not one for tiny kids - but for us bigger ones, this is fun.",

Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too! Anyway, it turns out that her pal isn't so friendly after all and pretty sharpish she is shot and face up in a pool of healing waters where her baby is being delivered by a jungle people with spidey-skills. Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic \"Cassie\" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner \"Ben\" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster. It's one such disaster, though, that sees her tumbled deep into the river and having to be rescued by her buddy. This trauma appears to trigger something weird. She is getting flash-fronts. She can see the tiniest snippets of the future - and that doesn't usually bode well for anyone, including her! A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be \"Deadpool\" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal \"Mattie\" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of \"Highlander\" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those \"Superman\" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting!",

Exploring the house looking to top up their supply of booze, they find a locked room full of all things occult and that includes an unique set of tarot cards. Rather foolishly, but typically disparagingly, they demand that \"Haley\" (Harriet Slater) read their fortunes. Next thing they are dropping like flies - all in a manner they gradually realise is akin to the results of the tarot reading. As they gruesomely dwindle, they realise that they are going to need some help and so thanks to Google spook, they find a woman (Olwen Fouéré) who informs them of the bleak history of their toxic tarot and tells them that the cards' destruction might be their only road to salvation. Thing is, can they survive long enough to get back to the house? There's nothing at all original here, sorry. We've seen it loads of times before and the uninteresting dynamic between the characters is even more predictable than the denouement. To be fair, the candle-lit visual effects are quite effective at times, but the acting is pretty dreadful and the whole frat-like presentation left me looking at the clock after half an hour. It's a shame. The whole astrology and mythology surrounding the tarot could have offered us a rich vein to tap into and exploit, but here we simply get a rather lazy and formulaic light-horror enterprise that's really devoid of much imagination.

It's an OK animation this, but the story is really quite thin with characters that don't much ignite the imagination - except, perhaps, the goat \"Valentino\" who has easily the best of what little comedy there is in the rather earnest script. The creatively entitled \"The Wish\" is the standard power ballad amongst the really quite unremarkable soundtrack that you just know is desperate to get to Leigh Harline's Disney theme tune \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" at the end. It's an amalgam of a few stories and will probably keep the youngsters entertained first time around.

The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother \"Fredo\" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.",

Against their better judgment our two decide to pretend to be a couple to provoke envy from one and protect the other from the intent of the meddling parents. What now ensues does really depend on a plausible degree of chemistry between Sweeney and Powell and I thought they did quite well. A little bit more meddling from Bryan Brown, some Di Caprio-esque action at the front of a yacht and some kindly support from the Sydney harbour rescue helicopter helps keep this amiably jogging along for an admittedly twenty minutes too long 1¾ hours. It's quite pithily written and manages to avoid the worst in both American and Australian stereotypes. It also isn't shy of sex, comic nudity and a bit of practical adult humour that makes a change from the usual puerile smut we are so frequently offered nowadays.

Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's \"Barbieland\". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink \"Groundhog Day\". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned \"Ken\" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a \"Barbie\". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical \"Barbie\" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See \"Weird Barbie\" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted \"Ken\" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by \"Sasha\" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged \"Ken\" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend \"Sasha\", her much less cyclical mother \"Gloria\" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever \"Carla\" from \"Cheers!\") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole \"Barbie\" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",

This is the first of the adventures of the \"Pevensie\" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous \"White Witch\" (Tilda Swinton). They align with \"Aslan\" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score.",

                "review": "Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young \"Dawson\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy \"Rose\" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée \"Hockley\" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother \"Ruth\" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, \"Rose\" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young \"Dawson\" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer \"Lovejoy\" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older \"Rose\" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.",

He's \"Eric\" who encounters \"Shellly\" (FKA twigs) and is then promptly embroiled in the devilish machinations of \"Roeg\" (Danny Huston) who ensures that his hench-woman \"Marion\" (Laura Birn) kills them both. Turns out, though, that \"Eric\" still has enough purity of soul left to return to the land of the living and so long as he is touched by true love's kiss sort of thing, will remain immortal long enough to avenge the couple. Yes, there is a crow - the embodiment of his spirit when he goes on his murderous spree, but that whole theme isn't at all developed so let's just forget about that and revert to the whole point of the film - an excuse to pack loads of slaughter, acrobatics and dark, eerie photography into all but two hours of repetitious mediocrity. The camera likes Skarsgård well enough, and there's certainly plenty of him to see here as he takes on all comers. Why were they killed though? Who is \"Roeg\"? Sure, you can put your own interpretation onto the story if you can be bothered, but director Rupert Sanders has almost entirely focussed on the gloomy and very wet imagery and decided against putting any meat on the bones of the story or the characters. There's a welcome paucity of dialogue throughout and FKA clearly twigged there wasn't much for her to do here so leaves much of the film to her co-star trying his best to be an amalgam of \"John Wick\" and \"Selene\" from \"Underworld\" (2003). It does look good but hasn't an original feather in it's body. It's nice to see Josette Simon (remember \"Blake's Seven\"?) on the big screen, albeit briefly, but this is really all very disappointing.",

He arrives is a town controlled by a chocolate cartel that is determined to use any means possible to ensure he can't fulfil his dream. That dream? Well ever since he was a child, he has wanted to make chocolate as well as his mother (Sally Hawkins). To do that, though, he needs a shop - and without a silver sovereign to his name that's not going to happen. It's winter, so his first order of business is somewhere to sleep. Luckily (?!?) \"Bleacher\" (Tom Davis) finds him on a cold bench and takes him to the welcoming arms of \"Mrs. Scrubbit\" (Olivia Colman) who offers him a bed for the night, though pretty soon he realises it's more of a bed in return for a life of indentured laundry servitude. Still, he's ingenious and he doesn't lose sight of his goal, so together with his fellow inmate \"Noodle\" (Calah Lane) and book-keeper \"Abacus Crunch\" (Jim Carter) they concoct a plan to addict the population to the young man's sweets whilst bringing down the evil trio of truffle terrorisers and ensuring \"Scrubbit\" and \"Bleacher' get their comeuppance too!.

It's a little over-choreographed, I think, and the original songs are not especially memorable, but it doesn't hang about and there's no doubting that Chalamet is enjoying himself, and that's a little bit contagious and we head to a denouement that takes fondue to a ridiculous level...

It follows the adventures of \"Mahito\" who arrives at the home of his factory-owning father amidst WWII. We appreciate quickly that his mother has died and that he is to have a new, expectant, mother in \"Natsuko\". When she mysteriously disappears and \"Mahito\" finds his presence \"requested\" by an enigmatic and beautiful grey heron, he strays into an old abandoned tower on his family estate and is soon embroiled in a world inhabited by people who are alive and, well, not! It seems the heron is not quite what it seemed, either, as he must explore rooms within rooms and endless doors that open into new scenarios. Pursued by giant pelicans, how can \"Mahito\" find his stepmother and return safely to their home? Luckily, along the way, he encounters the benevolently spiritual \"Kiriko\" as he finds himself the subject of some clever manipulation between the outwardly benign \"Grand Uncle\" who draws the power of life from a giant sacred stone he wishes to leave in the custody of our young explorer and the ambitious \"Pelican King\". You simply cannot fail to admire the vivid imagination of Miyazaki - the ideas and apparent randomness of the threads that gradually come together is hard enough to follow sometimes even when you have seen the denouement, and that's what makes these intricately drawn and characterised stories usually more intriguing and enjoying. Somehow, though, this was just a little too unstructured and meandering for my little brain. I've seen it twice now and maybe I just didn't engage with \"Mahito\" in the way I did with \"Howl\", \"Totoro\" or 'Chihiro\" or, indeed, with the story. It's still a glorious watch on a big screen and is certainly well worth watching. Just not sure it is in his top five, though!",

What now ensues are some pacily directed escapades with loads of attitude, swash and buckle. Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his \"Barbossa\" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It's a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce's \"Gov. Swann\" and an whole suite of powdered wigs.

Mid way through the evening, they don their glad rags and join in the party. A little accident gets \"Frida\" introduced to their host and after a few glasses of Champagne, the two are thick as thieves. His chief of staff, \"Vic\" (Christian Slater) needs to go somewhere warm so he can have a drink with an umbrella in it, so they readily accept an invitation from their new-found friend to visit his paradise island where together with a group of his other friends, they will enjoy some sunshine, fine dining and drugs-galore. What's a bit unnerving on this otherwise Elysian estate, is the old woman (María Elena Olivares) who seems to spend her time gathering up some beautiful yellow snakes that roam the place freely but whose venom can be dangerous. It's only when \"Jess\" gets bitten that her friend begins to wonder just what is going on here. It's all just too idyllic, and when the old lady gives her a shot of something to drink that isn't from an hand-blown bottle - well, reality starts to kick in and things take on a much more sinister reality not just for her, but for all of the women going about their days in blissful, powder-induced, ignorance. It's got something of the Agatha Christie meets \"Glass Onion\" to it, this - and for maybe the first half hour is quite intriguing, but once the story gets into gear it just becomes too implausible. Sure, it plays to vanity and the readiness of folks to believe what clearly is too good to be true, but as the story builds to a denouement there is one whopping great Achilles' heel in the premiss that even the occasional presence of his perma-ditzy assistant \"Stacy\" (Geena Davis) can't rescue. It's a good looking drama, but the acting is as unremarkable as the dialogue and though I did quite like the irony of the final conclusion, the plot is just way too thin as we work our way there. This is typical summertime cinema fayre that tries to mix comedy with thriller but in the end just looks like a good excuse for Tatum, Slater et al to have some fun in the sun.",

Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape from the collapsing dome and poor old \"Peeta\" is being used, shamelessly, by the authorities to try and paint \"Katniss\" as the epitome of revolution and evil and so the scene is set: rescue him and mass their forces for an attack that will eliminate the totalitarian regime once and for all. Aside from one of two combat scenes, very little actually happens here. There is a great deal of dialogue, plenty of moralising and if I'm honest, \"Coin\" doesn't come across as any more trustworthy than the man she hopes to succeed. There simply isn't enough by way of plot to sustain this for two hours and the acting still, largely, refuses to engage me. Liam Hemsworth (\"Gale\") features a little more, but the confused does she/doesn't she romance stuff is exasperating as this supposedly emotionally and sexually charged environment delivers nothing by way of passion - indeed the pace of the whole thing borders on the racial.

Meantime some of his other, long deceased, family are also on his trail bent on returning him home without his music. To be honest, I found the underlying tale of loyalty and family to be just a bit overly-sentimental at times, but the quality and vivacity of the animation is a class apart - huge great eyes and smiles that tell the story so much better than words ever could. The story marries the musical with the dastardly and mysterious nicely with a well written script and a quickly paced storyline that is really quite entertaining.

Desperate to save his dad from the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite being warned against this potentially reckless action by \"Batman\" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn't the only thing that's changing on the old space-time continuum and shortly after, \"General Zod\" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his home world of \"Krypton\" on the people of Earth. \"Barry\" has to think on his nimble feet, and try to assemble what he can of the \"Justice League\" to combat this threat. Turns out \"Bruce Wayne\" (now Michael Keaton) has rather let himself go and \"Superman\" is being held in an impenetrable metal scrotum in Siberia. Time to galvanise and get a-rescuing before his future, all of their futures, are lost. Can they all save the world? I liked this film. It's got loads of action, plenty of pith in a script that is at the more adult (without loads of expletives) end of the spectrum and Miller has the \"P\" word. Personality. They are clearly enjoying this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It's fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman's cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine as he rehabilitates his disillusioned \"Batman\" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It's so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller's interpretation of \"Barry\" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin's pure as the driven snow portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different. Sure, we all know of their much publicised flaws, but I hope the studio look past that and commit to a sequel that allows this actor to continue to do what they do well here - and that's to entertain us. Needs a big screen, it will look very ordinary on the telly.",

These folks are called \"beekeepers\" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of \"Eloise\" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter \"Verona\" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. \"Clay\" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with \"Clay\" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.",

                "review": "It seems like I have been watching the trailers for this film for years now - and you know what? Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous \"Top Gun\" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate \"Goose\" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner \"Penny\" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral \"Kazansky\" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don't wait til it is on the telly.",

The world's most wanted wizard \"Sirius Black\" (Gary Oldman) escapes from \"Azkaban\" allegedly bent on the destruction of \"Harry\". The script has more by way of addition to the original book, but in a complementary - not detracting way. As the children grow into young adults, we are exposed to a scarier side of their existence - the \"Dementors\" that are supposed to protect the innocent and the \"Boggart\" all serve to introduce a physical fluidity to this shape-shifting environment of peril in which they now exist. The presence of \"Valdemort\" becomes more omnipresent and there is so much more substance to the stories now.

We know that he (\"Kid\") routinely dons a monkey mask for some wrestling and he duly gets a pasting - but that this all has purpose. That purpose starts to come together when he manages to organise a subtle sting operation on \"Queenie\" (Ashwini Kalsekar) who runs an high-end gentleman's club. His reward here is a job. In the kitchens, bleaching the toilets and washing the pots. A means to an end though as he befriends the drug-pusher \"Alphonso\" (Pitobash) - who has a nifty, turbo-charged, tuk-tuk, and is soon elevated to the rank of waiter to the corrupt and profligate of city society who frequent the place. Interspersed with his burgeoning career, we begin to see flashbacks of his childhood - and of the brutality that reduced him to his present, vengeful, circumstances. The story is set against a backdrop of political turmoil and with an election looming, he becomes aware that there are wheels within wheels and that his principle antagonist is firmly amongst the secular and religious plotters. He also finds himself being cared for by a sagely monk \"Alpha\" (Vipin Sharma) who helps him to focus both his mind and his body as we build to a denouement that can be seen from space by anyone who's ever seen a \"John Wick\" film. Patel is a charismatic man but that's not what's needed here. That's something just a little more original to keep this over-long two hours from becoming just a bit dull and procedural. It's not terrible, but it's not really up to much either.",

She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy \"Carlita\" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues \"Margaret\" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with \"Fr. Brennan\" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what \"jump moments\" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death. A short story over-stretched.",

His is a naturally structured existence that is driven by what's needed to stay fed, warm and watered. It's not quite a rustic life, though, there are plenty of mod cons - cars, electricity and the like, and his curious daughter \"Hana\" (Ryo Nishikawa) goes to the local school from where he regularly forgets to pick her up! The local planners and a talent agency have cottoned on to the beauty of this unspoilt area and have decided it could be ideal for a clamping site. A town meeting is organised and two city-folks turn up with precious little idea as to the impact their plans might have. Sent away with a flea in their ear, their bosses come up with a very watered down compromise to provide for a permanent caretaker - and they want to offer that job as a sop to \"Takumi\". What now follows sees the city-folks become more engrossed in his country ways until he, again, forgets to pick up his child and she goes missing. They all have to search high and low for her as the darkness and cold settles in for the night. Oddly enough it's the laconic dialogue and the gentle pacing that make this story a bit more interesting. The reconciliation of progress with nature, the clear clamour for profits at all costs and the power of persuasion all play their part before a slightly mystical denouement that rather emphasises the continuity of nature regardless of man's involvement. The young Nishikawa delivers sensitively as the film offers us quite an unique look at how man and it's environment ought to synergise.",

The animation is characterful and top notch - and the story certainly had potential, but somehow the thing just becomes a bit of a cheesy romance all too quickly. A lot more fun could have been had demonstrating just how incompatible the four - air, earth, water and fire - can be when mixed together; or - indeed - how symbiotic they can be, but the emphasis and the dialogue focusses just a bit too much on \"Ember\" and \"Wade\" and I am afraid that I rather lost interest. It's colourful and vibrant, there is some entertaining action with plenty of pyrotechnics and is worth a watch, but it will look just as good on the television and doesn't live up to the hype, sorry",

Rob Marshall has taken the helm and we have lost Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - who presumably recognised that the boat has sailed on this much weakened fantasy adventure series. This time around \"Jack\" (a rather battle-weary Johnny Depp) finds himself looking for the fountain of youth with the newly Anglicised \"Barbossa\" (Geoffrey Rush) in hot pursuit of him and of his old flame \"Angelica\" (Penélope Cruz) who happens to be none other than the the daughter of the legendary \"Blackbeard\" (Ian McShane). Now she is clever. She convinces \"Jack\" that her dad isn't so well, and that only an elixir of this water can cure him. Thing is, is \"Jack\" gullible enough to fall for this yarn? Are we? Of course it's not so simple - not only do they need to find the water, they must also find a couple of charmed chalices and, naturally, the tear of a mermaid - the latter creatures not being so benign as Walt Disney's other films might suggest. The visuals are great with a new slew of scary beasties from the depths to entertain us, but the story is pretty weak and the established characterisations struggle to resonate in anything like the way they used to. Sam Claflin adds a bit of eye candy and Richard Griffiths looks every inch the part as George II, but McShane is one of my least favourite character actors - he only has the one gear - and Miss Cruz seems more like a fish out of water than a duck taking to it. There's far too much dialogue and the denouement is stretched beyond breaking point before the obligatory \"next time\" pointer to the next instalment of this over-tired series. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" ought to hang up it's hat now; it's had it's day.",

The first one was great fun, the second almost as good , but this film is just a poor cousin that really struggles from a weak storyline that never really gets going. The megalomaniacal \"High Evolutionary\" (Chikwudi Iwuji) has set his sights on retrieving \"Rocket\" after having discovered that our feisty raccoon is a product of sophisticated genetic engineering - and that has enabled him to think and grow as a being; a skill that is hugely valuable to this global-scale cloner. Snag is, \"Rocket\" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from \"Warlock\" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. \"Quill\" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the \"Guardians\" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji.

When we do actually focus on things mystic, the story revolves around a brass sphere that is covered with ancient hieroglyphics. This comes into the possession of 'Stantz\" (Dan Aykroyd) who takes it to the team for further investigation. Needless to say, that causes quite a bit of mayhem whilst, meantime, the mayor (William Atherton) is after the \"Ghostbusters\" for causing expensive havoc every time they trap a ghost. That contretemps will question the very existence of their firehouse operation and of their ongoing mission to boldy go... Anyway, as the plot lurches along we get the odd opportunity to see some proton packs in action; the old car gets put through it's paces and the original \"Bibendum\" ghosts get an outing or two, too, as a sort of bellwether for impending doom. That impending doom is all delivered, frostily, too little and too late to rescue this entirely derivative two hours from the cinema doldrums. The original cast - Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Aykroyd really need to stop appearing to legitimise these sequels - they are not patch on the original and really do smell, strongly, of flogging the dead horse.

The animation of the game is lively and at times quite visceral. Each player has their set task within their own team - they must continually evolve their tactics on the court as each pushes the other to new standards, to move quicker or jump higher. One team is much more aggressive and forceful with the ball, the other much more adept at controlling the pace and hopefully frustrating errors from their opponents - and the exhausting dedication required to play as well as the emotional trials faced is well captured as the story reaches it's denouement. It's based on a series I haven't seen, but unlike many of it's contemporaries, this film provides for enough of the backstory via flashback and narration to give us enough information to be able to treat this more as a stand alone story within the confines of the match itself. The style of artwork is very two-dimensional with precious little effort gone into activating the crowd beyond the audio, but the close up nature of the facial and athletic imagery as well as the soundtrack give the thing quite an intensity and show just how team sports can be character-building and to an extent, even life affirming.

As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2½ hours and it doesn't quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the \"Harry Potter\" character.",

Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so \"Mike\" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer \"Vanessa\" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take \"Abby\" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of \"Mike\" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",

It's all about \"Anastasia\" (Dakota Johnson) who goes to interview hunky gazillionaire \"Christian\" (Jamie Dornan) in his plush office. A bit of flirting ensues as he makes it quite clear that he is interested - but boy, is she in for a surprise when she discovers that all belts and braces does actually having another meaning (as does butt-plug!). What now follows is, I felt, a really tame exercise in soft porn that is about as sexy as putting out the wheelie bin. Dornan is very easy on the eye, but otherwise we are all subjected to a dull, ploddingly produced series of poorly lit scenes that drag on interminably. There's no point evaluating the acting nor the script, they don't matter. This is just a poor attempt to entertain or shock or both that does neither, remotely. Titillatingly tantalising? Nah - just dull. Nice helicopter but the song didn't win either award.",

It's no longer a cheesy, children's franchise - but a dark, gritty and thoughtful piece of work from David Yates that really does convey some of the sinister and malevolent aspects of JK Rowling's book. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all but grown up - whether they are old enough, or not - and with their friends and allies must now prepare for the final battle with \"Voldemort\". This involves the seeking out and destruction of the crucial horcruxes that each contain a part of the life-force of their evil foe. The writing is taut, as is the direction - the personalities of the three characters we have followed for the last 9 years have developed into plausible people - with quirks, strengths, weaknesses - and (sadly) even romantic tendencies. It's fantastic cinema, with captivating visual effects, characterisations and a much more mature storyline that deals with both triumph and disaster using a superb ensemble cast drawn from amongst the best actors who all contribute to build a real sense of unity and jeopardy ahead of part 2.... One for the big screen, definitely...",

                "review": "Well if you though it was wet on \"Blade Runner\" (1982) then welcome to a ruined city where the torrential rain never seems to stop. A series of flashbacks tells us that two graves hold the bodies of a young couple about to be married. That's before local kingpin \"Top Dollar\" (Michael Wincott), who had designs on their building, sent his henchmen to \"coax\" them out. A year after this tragedy a crow alights on the grave of \"Eric\" (Brandon Lee) and enlivens his corpse so that he may avenge the brutality visited on his fiancée and himself. What now ensues is a dark and menacing revenge thriller that, though fairly predictable, sees this former rock musician develop some astonishingly lethal ninja skills as he identifies and then rather entertainingly despatches a variety of drug dealing undesirables whilst retaining a sense of the decent by befriending local cop \"Albrecht\" (Ernie Hudson) and re-connecting with the young \"Sarah\" (Rochelle Davis) whose mother is another of the addicts in this dismal and hopeless city. It's the enigmatic \"Myca\" (Bai Ling) who spots the Achilles heel of our hero and so sets a scene with her menacing beau as \"Eric\" hones in on the final stage of a challenge that will hopefully allow him to return to his own grave in peace. Lee is really is in his element here and Alex Proyas and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski use the grim, sodden and ruined environment to depict as physical a corruption as the story does a societal one. What dialogue there is is largely left to an engaging contribution from Hudson, who has his own mini axe to grind with his police colleagues who saw him busted from detective for trying to investigate the activities of \"Dollar\" before. When you watch this film, you can't help but think on the number of other characterisations it has spawned, and it shows how revenge horror can work without resorting to endless special effects and jump-scenes. A cinema screening is best - a big dark room that makes you hear that relentless rain fall all around you.",

Meantime, the handsome prince (Richard Madden) who appears to have had his breeches sprayed onto his body, is unhappy. His father (Sir Derek Jacobi) needs him to take a wife - but whom? Well, the fairy tale sets out the rest of the story and Sir Kenneth Branagh sticks faithfully enough to it. Helena Bonham Carter arrives to turn the pumpkin into a coach and... It's quite an adequate adaptation, this. The attention to detail is superb, a strong testament to the costumier's arts with a fine Patrick Doyle score (and a bit of \"Bibbiddi-Bobbiddi-Boo\") to accompany what is a well cast, and good looking film. There is certainly too much reliance on CGI, there's not a great deal of chemistry between Madden and James, and I could have done with a little more input from Blanchett, Sir Derek - and the entertaining Stellan Skarsgård as the \"Grand Duke\" but for the most part this flows along stylishly. The eagle-eyed amongst us might spot a young Josh C'Connor in an equally tight uniform, too! Is it Disney or \"Slipper and the Rose\" (1976)? Maybe a bit of both, but not so good as either?",

It's only a matter of time before heads clash and, well - you can guess the rest of this actually rather brutally predictable drama. Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra. It's overlong for what it is, and I found Washington's performance to be rather sluggish throughout before a denouement that came across as rather simplistically rushed. It's fine, but forgettable.",

Fairly quickly her investigations take her to a girl's school where a previous tragedy has left a room completely sealed off and that's where she senses the source of this evil may be lurking. Can she figure out who this demon is and thwart it's ambitions - ambitions that really centre on the absorption of her own, true, spirit? Well, what do you think? We have a bit of eye candy from Jonas Bloquet's handyman \"Maurice\" but that's countered by far too many children - so often the death knell in horror films with their screeching, squealing and toxic effect on the jeopardy of any story - if only they would actually just do as they were told! To be fair, though, they are not the only thing that drags this down. It's all so very verbal, procedural and predictable. Even the visual effects are a direct descendent of the first film with a denouement that cannot be a shock to anyone. I know it's hard to reinvent the wheel in this genre, but films like this really offer very little by way of creative innovation, acting/writing skills or even providing the merest hint of scariness.

These laudable characteristics are the result of an upbringing by his mother (Sally Field) which has seen him grow from the bullied young boy from Alabama who discovers that he can run a little faster than your average bear, to a sort of national hero. We learn all this from him as he sits at a bus stop chatting to an initially disinterested nurse, and then to a collection of fellow travellers who learn of his drafting to Vietnam. That's where he meets \"Lt. Dan\" (Gary Sinese) and his new best friend \"Bubba\" (Mykelti Williamson) and where his innate sense of what's right saves lives and earns him the plaudits of a grateful nation (and gets his butt-ox on television too!). His army days taught him much, but nothing so useful as a skill at table tennis. Soon on the American ping-pong squad in China, he manages to get an endorsement that allows him to reunite with the hippified, now paraplegic and disillusioned \"Lt. Dan\" and make a mint shrimp fishing, before returning home to face some fairly predicable family trauma. All of this has been happening against a story of a longing for his one true love. \"Jenny\" (Robin Wright). They've been friends since childhood, but she has a wandering spirit and though his love was requited, it wasn't what he needed. Might there be a future for them, ever? Robert Zemeckis uses a chronology of events in the USA, starting in the 1950s, to create a template for the story of a man who lived through racial tension, war, bullying and emerged the stronger; the more honourable and despite his low IQ was quite capable of putting those more intellectual around him to shame. The photography that cleverly superimposes him into television broadcasts works entertainingly as he gazes bemusedly out onto a audience that is increasingly warming to him. I will admit, I struggled a bit with the running segment towards the end, but Hanks epitomises determination and integrity with Eric Roth's adaptation of the Groom novel allowing plenty of philosophical food for thought whilst having a laugh at scenarios both serious and ridiculous. Like life itself, this film is like a box of chocolates and though I didn't love them all, there were plenty to enjoy and reflect upon.",

The victims are the usual mix of couples who are together, were together, want to be together; there's the obligatory couple of lesbians (though not for long) and way, way, too many meandering shots of the malevolent critter walking through the woods time and time again. There's some quite entertainingly graphic use of visual effects now and again as he makes good use of his chain, spike, hook and axe - but the big question is: can he be stopped before auteur Chris Nash starts thinking sequel? I suppose the moral of the story is - don't take things that don't belong to you; and maybe if this were shown in primary schools across the country, it might serve as an effective illustration of the risks of violating the seventh commandment.

Student \"Max\" (Ramy Youssef) is a student recruited by his professor \"Godwin\" (Willem Dafoe - aka \"God\") to come and help him work on his latest project. She's called \"Bella\" (Emma Stone) and it soon transpires that she is the product of some very creative surgery on the part of \"God\" - a man who has, himself, had one or two experiences under the knife at the hands of his scientist father! You see, a pregnant woman took her own life by jumping from a bridge, but was luckily fished out of the water before her baby died. The surgeon managed to deliver the baby then replace the dead brain of the adult with the one from the nascent infant! Needless to say, \"Bella\" is on an actively steep learning curve and is quite capable of throwing the odd tantrum to get what she wants - and that is, initially, to go out and explore. Gradually more empowered, and a little more mature, she discovers the delights of the orgasm - and after that there's no stopping her. \"God\" tries to control her by suggesting a marriage to \"Max\" but he insists on such a fastidious contract that \"Duncan\" (Mark Ruffalo) concludes she must be worth investigating. He meets her and offers her her dreams, she convinces \"God\" to let her go with him and soon she is embarked on a trip around Europe enjoying the frequent delights of \"furious jumping\"! The always learning woman soon tires of her beau, and realises that she can have loads of fun and earn at the same time - before \"God\" falls ill and she must return home to not just that life, but surprisingly to the one she thought she had left behind on the bridge. This film is genuinely laugh-out-loud at times, and the performance from Emma Stone has to be her best. She plays the almost porcelain-like and childish \"Bella\" when we meet her expertly, and that skill prevails as her character evolves into a savvy, street-smart and capable woman who quickly learns to fight fire with fire. Ruffalo is also on super form as her travelling companion and Kathryn Hunter also turns in a solid performance as her Parisian paymaster \"Swiney\". The narrative takes us on a fantastic tour of European cities, but also on a wonderfully evocative tour of humanity - warts and all. \"Bella\" has a practical and analytical mind that at times seems ludicrously detached, then somehow she ends up having got it right all along. It might look a bit long at just shy of 2½ hours but it really flies by and I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor billy goat at the end of this creatively interpreted and very well adapted story of what were originally supposed to be Glaswegian hotspots!",

It is told in two parts - the first sees a son \"Simba\" born to the king \"Mufasa\"; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend \"Nala\" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo \"Zazu\". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother \"Scar\" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - \"Nala\" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling.

They are to whisk her away to a remote, quite spooky, manor house where she is to be held hostage til dad stumps up $50m.

Quite quickly we realise that it's not her who is trapped in their web, but vice-versa and what now ensues sees quite a fun series of daft and gruesome encounters as their gang gradually dwindles and they have to fight for their lives! It runs out of steam a bit towards the ending - which seems to happen quite a few times, but a solid cast including the entertaining Kevin Durand and Kathryn Newton, some quickly paced direction and some pithy writing keeps most of this moving along with the diverse range of characters (and intellects) making for quite an enjoyable romp in a sort of \"Cluedo\" with loads of ketchup style.

Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the \"Forbin Project\" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn't that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it's own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of \"007\", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to \"Ethan\" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal \"Ilsa\" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered \"Grace\" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic \"Gabriel\" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in \"Fast X\" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even \"Hercule Poirot\" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge. It's entertaining and serves well as a vehicle for the star, setting up the concluding part which, of course, leaves the plot here having to be a little undercooked and a touch predictable. Better than I was expecting and well worth a big screen outing.",

                "review": "Well it's certainly a saga! Against a backdrop of the American Civil war we are introduced to half a dozen different spokes on the wheel of pioneering America that gradually head towards a centre of what I assume will be the creation of the fabric of modern day USA by the end of part four. It begins rather brutally when a woman shoots a man then flees the scene with her infant child. Despite her proximity to the victim he survives and orders his two sons to pursue her. Meantime, there's a wagon train heading across the Apache dominated territory under the command of \"Matthew\" (Owen Wilson) and, separately, \"Hayes\" (Kevin Costner) is doing a bit of wintery horse-trading. With the younger Apache restless and determined to do what they can to thwart the encroachment on their ancient hunting grounds, they attack another white-man's settlement decimating the population. It's only after some sterling riding from the young \"Russell\" (Etienne Kellici) to a nearby army post that we meet \"Lt. Gephart\" (Sam Worthington) and his sagely \"Sgt. Major Riordan\" (Michael Rooker) who arrive to pick up the pieces amidst the charred ruins. The survivors include the terrified \"Frances\" (Sienna Miller) and her daughter \"Lizzie\" (Georgie MacPhail) whom they rescue from a tunnel in which they were hiding. The two adults immediately click perhaps offering us a glimmer of romance for the remorseful widow? Across the country, \"Hayes\" arrives in a small settlement where he encounters the good-time girl \"Marigold\" (Abbey Lee) and her young baby who just happen to be the one the avenging sons are looking for. Needless to say he, and his Colt revolver, have to come to the rescue and they decide it's better to take to the hills to avoid yet more trouble. With the forbidding west outstretched before these characters and the dangers and demons of their pasts never far behind them, the adventure is teed up for part two. To be fair, this looks great with some stunning drone cinematography illustrating really well the the scope of this virgin land that is every bit as hostile at times as those who have lived there for generations. There's also some impressive battle scenes as the maturing natives try to protects their homeland. The style of the rest of the narrative is just all a bit too bitty, though. Costner doesn't really appear until hour two and the substantial elements of the plot draw heavily from a very well established genre that it was always going to be difficult to reinvent or reimagine. The score helps it along rousingly at times and dialogue is sparingly used by most of the characters which is also quite a sensible tactic as we quickly realise we are in for just as long a slog as the settlers. It's the necessary character establishment part of this story which we can only hope will pad out the people more and rely less on the visuals as the story progresses. Otherwise, it's not really much better than a series of episodes of \"Bonanza\" bolted together.",

From what? Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the \"Lockwood\" dynasty that co-founded the original park with \"Hammond\" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic \"Dodgson\" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where \"Sattler\" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal \"Grant\" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis \"Malcolm\" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company's sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor \"Blue\" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot \"Kayla\" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser \"Mummy\" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It's all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren't enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn't cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers. It looks great on big screen, includes a few bars now and again from John Williams masterful 1993 score, but for the main part this is a pretty mediocre conclusion to a great franchise with an ending that is rushed and entirely predictable.",

I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy \"Woody\". He is the favourite of owner \"Andy\" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger \"Buzz Lightyear\". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and \"Woody\" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving \"Woody\" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast \"Buzz\" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (\"Mr. Potato Head\") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.",

That's pretty much what Gore Verbinsky has done with this superior follow-up to the 2003 story. This time, we don't really need to spend much time on the who's who bits, so can head straight to the action which for the next 2½ hours follows \"Jack Sparrow\" (Johnny Depp) double-dealing as only he can trying to stay one step ahead of the vengeful \"Davy Jones\" (Bill Nighy) with whom he made a deal that means it's now his turn to enter hell. Meantime, \"Will\" (Orlando Bloom) and \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) are having problems of their own, and when he has to try to kidnap \"Jack\" with his compass for the dastardly \"Lord Beckett\" (Tom Hollander) in return for her safety he, en route, becomes reunited with his rather curmudgeonly (and barnacled) father (Stellan Skarsgård). It seems that both \"Will\" and \"Jack\" cannot both get what they need - but can they find a solution? It's end-to-end stuff this, with loads of mythical creatures from the depths, a tiny bit of romance and a Johnny Depp very much at the top of his game. The story is solid and entertaining, as is much of the quickly paced dialogue and David Schofield turns in a good effort as the malevolent \"Mercer\". I could have done with Geoffrey Rush but otherwise this is a fun fantasy adventure with some cracking visual effects and Hans Zimmer's music adds richness to the jollity too.

Thing is, tragedy strikes very early on in the film and \"Christmas\" is taken off the team that is sent to avenge that. Is he staying home to fester? Of course not, and lucky too - for soon he is trying to free his pals from captivity before all hell breaks loose. Plenty of pyrotechnics, a bit of contrived sexual chemistry (with Megan Fox's \"Gina\") and loads of bullets and missiles flying around keep the film moving along well enough, but the story is the thinnest of the thin; the baddie's identity is hardly a challenge to discover nor is the twist in the tale at the end remotely unexpected. Good to see that the acting colossus that is Dolph Lundgren is still getting on screen nowadays, but otherwise this really is unremarkable stuff that even the usually charismatic Statham can't really sustain.",

                "review": "I think this is one of those films, like his \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) epic that Sir Ridley Scott has made for aficionados of grand scale historical cinema, not for historians. Indeed it may well be that for this film, the less you actually know about the subject the more you might enjoy it. We start with the demise of Marie Antoinette and see Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) watching from the baying crowd. He's a relatively junior officer but an aspirational one who manages to sell a plan to relieve the British occupied city of Toulon to his boss Barras (Tahar Rahim). This success sets him on a parabola that sees him rise, his falling in/out/in of love with the charismatic Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and his overwhelming desire for European domination. The narrative clearly illustrates the fickleness of dynastic politics, trust and betrayal, love, lust and shrieking hypocrisy in a colourful and vibrant fashion. I didn't love Phoenix in this role, but maybe because Rod Steiger was so convincing in \"Waterloo\" (1970) that at times he looked a little like a mimic. That said, though, he puts his heart and soul into the role and the increasingly toxic dynamic with Kirby manages to stay on the right side of melodrama throughout. Again, as with Sir Ridley's tale of Jerusalem from eighteen years ago, he manages to pull off some spectacular battle scenes and the cinematography captures well the hostile environments - human and natural - faced by the soldiers as his empire building rose and fell. Although it's over 2½ hours long, I felt the focus was rather imbalanced. A long time spent on his rise to power then his decline and fall rather rushed. Dare I say it, but this might have worked better as a part one and a part two scenario. It looks stunning and the creative forces behind the costumes and visual effects are bound to be picking up a slew of gongs in due course. The acting, well that's less impressive and though I do enjoy the genre, I fear this may just end up being famed for some historical inaccuracies rather than being for an outstanding biopic of one of the world's most enigmatic and flawed megalomaniacs.",

The three principals are very much on the same wavelength now; the supporting cast likewise and there is even a little late hormonal activity as the awkwardness of teenage years (remember?) starts to feature too. This film also sees the arrival of Jim Broadbent as \"Slughorn\" - quite an engagingly enigmatic character and we can easily now sense that the battle lines are starting to be drawn...

Initially hopelessly outgunned by his nemesis's sonic gun, he has to resort to the drastic step of rescuing his imprisoned brother \"Orm\" (Patrick Wilson) - whom you may recall he was instrumental in deposing and incarcerating in the first place; and hoping that he will join forces with them, \"Atlanna\" (Nicole Kidman) and \"King Nereus\" (an almost unrecognisable Dolph Lundgren). With battles lines drawn the films goes from \"Narnia\" to \"Middle Earth\" via the \"Lost World\" and even a bit of \"Ice Station Zebra\" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the \"Brine King\" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.",

Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the \"Sorcerer Supreme\" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the \"Avengers\" movies; there is still far too much slack here.

Little do they know, though, that he has applied to join the \"Vicious Six\" who have, themselves, just dumped their founder member \"Wild Knuckles\". They aren't so impressed when he turns up at the interview but he uses his newly designed glue-gun to escape with their all powerful, emerald encrusted, stone. Now the five are on the warpath as he entrusts the stone to his minion friend \"Otto\", but he manages to swap it for a pebble with eyes so now embarks on a mammoth cycle ride to fetch it back whilst the pursuing villains cause havoc. Luckily, \"Wild Knuckles\" hasn't given up. He kidnaps \"Gru\" to get the stone back, but when he realises that he no longer has it, the two form an unlikely, and quite amusing, partnership to retrieve it. I guess I'm just the wrong demographic for this, because although it hits the ground running and never stops for breath, I just didn't really get it. The yellow ovoid creatures are fun, but hardy the stuff of big screen entertainment and the plot reminded me of the recently released \"Bad Guys\" animation that I didn't much like either. It's my first foray into \"Despicable\" territory, but the slapstick approach to the whole thing will probably ensure it's my last. Others will love it, I'm sure - the cinema on a Sunday night was packed to the rafters, but this hadn't enough for the grown up in me to remain engaged for long.",

Ancient rivalries and battles between humanity, the deities and some marvellously created mystical beasts - especially the dragons - form the basis of the story set some three millennia ago. Personally, I tended to the side of the immortals - and there's even the slightest hint of a bromance for one of them - as the \"Demon Fox\", and the manipulative \"King Zhou\" use mankind's greed, avarice, loyalty and decency to ensure they retain their place at the top of the mountain. The visual effects are usually top drawer and the action scenes avoid the often lazily constructed, repetitive, style of combat scenes. Now the acting isn't the best - indeed there is plenty of woodenness for us to inspect here, and I also found it a bit over-scored, but the richness of the mythology could, a bit like \"Lord of the Rings\", perhaps, provide for more characterful adventures and personality development in the next film. For a part one, though, it's a long, but increasingly quite compelling watch if you like the genre and appreciate the wealth of stories before us. Get comfy though - we're in for a long ride!",

Also, we discover that \"JJ\" is a bit of a thug and prone to beating up his wife. A trip to the hospital for her causes tempers to flare, and pumped full of steroids, it's the increasingly unstable \"Jackie\" who sets things in motion that are going to bring to an head a decade of family tensions, put lives at risk and even drag in the FBI. Aside from the same sex angle, there is nothing new at all to this half-hearted relationship drama that contrives to introduce just about everything to go wrong that can and in the end seems to be trying more to parody \"The Incredible Hulk\" than make headway with anything different. The denouement is weak and surreal on just about every level, too. Just because Rose Glass decides to feature loads of turbulent female bonding and making out doesn't make this worth watching. It just looks like a self indulgent and proud statement of sexuality for the sake of it, regardless of the strength or brutality of the story. People have been making characterful lesbian films in Europe for a century or more, this isn't remotely revelatory. Dark humour? Hmmm - must have missed that bit.",

The team now travel to a remote installation where they must investigate some more of the beasties that live below the frozen layer put there by nature to ensure than we don't mix. Thing is, it seems they are not the only folks who've hit on the idea that there might be untapped riches 25,000 feet below the surface, and soon our team are involved in a contretemps with \"Montes\" (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) that introduces treachery, double-dealing and causes explosions galore that release not just megs, but also an enormous octopus into the ocean where they can merrily terrorise the holidaymakers on the nearby resort of \"Fun Island\". Can \"Jonas\" et al manage to take on four of these super-creatures before they've snacked their way through the tourists? This might have been a bit better if they'd just cut all the preamble and gone straight to the rig and to the underwater action, big fish and pyrotechnics. As it is, we spend far too long meandering about on the surface meeting the characters and there's way too much pointless dialogue throughout - though one or two half-hearted witticisms and puns help a little - before an ending that is entirely predictable and really rather processionally so. The acting is just banal, the continuity is all over the place - as is the editing - and the huge chunk of Ali Baba money that's floated this thing ensures that the switches from the English to Chinese languages actually smacks more of keeping everybody happy in the boardroom rather than engaging anyone in the actual cinema. Simply, even the charismatic Statham cannot rescue this from the doldrums of CGI-led mediocrity that churns out an unremarkable hybrid of \"Jaws\" and \"Jurassic Park\". It does need a big screen.

We know that \"Constance\" (Lyna Khoudri) has been kidnapped and that the enamoured \"D'Artagnan\" (François Civil) is determined to get her back - but how? Well the almost fatal attack on the king (Louis Garrel) has galvanised everyone - friend and foe, and the musketeers determine that they must get to the ringleader of that plot before it is eventually accomplished and the kingdom is plunged into chaotic warfare. Now everyone suspects the malevolent Cardinal Richelieu (Eric Ruf) but surely it's not in his interests to kill Louis XIII? The Queen (Vicky Krieps) and her not-so-secret English lover Buckingham (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd) might be in the mix, or maybe just a disgruntled nobleman? \"D'Artagnan\" is first with a clue after he inadvertently rescues \"Milady\" (Eva Green) from a prison (after she fell off a cliff!) armed with a secret, coded letter. What does it mean? Can it help find his love and save the kingdom? Meantime, we start to learn a little more about this enigmatic \"MIlady\" and of her relationship with \"Athos\" (Vincent Cassel) whilst his two pals \"Aramis\" (Romain Duris) and the affable \"Porthos\" (Pio Marmaï) do their bit for the story and the country too. It looks great - the settings, the costumes, the combat scenes all smack of effort having been spent on making the scenarios ring true. I'm still no great fan of Eva Green, but here she starts to exude just the tiniest hint of menace as the story builds to the conclusion of this search for love and traitors. It's a wee bit more earnest, this time around - there's less humour and I missed that. I don't mean laugh out loud stuff, but here we rarely see all the musketeers together; their camaraderie isn't so obvious. This is essentially Civil v Green and that doesn't always work so well. Still, it's a solid and quickly paced adventure story that I found passed two hours effortlessly.",

Military plans for the killer beasties are the reason, but as we all know by now - nature finds a way, and after some dodgy DNA sequencing, they face an enemy that presents a terrifying hybrid of alien and human that could threaten Earth itself. It is up to her, whom the aliens still think is one of then, and a disparate bunch of space pirates to try to thwart the creatures - and to survive! This offers quite a shocking indictment of just how state-sponsored science, coupled with militaristic aspirations can lead to some hideous creations but aside from that rather obvious moral imperative, the rest of this is pretty routine. There is no shock left for us to feel; we have seen it all before and just like last time, the folks getting gobbled up are largely deserving of their fates. Winona Ryder's (\"Call\") adds a little quirkiness to the plot later on, but otherwise this is all just completely forgettable, churned out sci-fi that, though quite quickly paced and complete with some great special effects, offers nothing new.",

Even as far away as in the United States, his family are being tormented by a spirit. They are all led to a remote grave atop a hill that is marked simply by a plain gravestone with no name, just some seemingly random numbers. The buried man was of some importance so the fact that his grave was not ideally placed (only 65/100 on the best plot to have scale) arouses suspicion. They proceed to exhume the uniquely carved juniper coffin and decide to cremate it, but it's considered unlucky to do this in wet weather so leaving it respectfully dressed, plan to complete the process in the morning. This is their first mistake for overnight it falls prey to an inquisitive member of their team who releases an even more menacing entity bent on revenge on all those who left him at 65%! That is just the start of their woes, though. Returning to the grave for a ritual, they discover an even larger, chain-wrapped, box buried vertically - and one with no name, neither! It's now we head straight into \"Mummy\" mode and the adventure really does pick up. Can they identify this leviathan of menace and terror and thwart it's centuries-old battle plan? I did quite enjoy this. It taps into a fascinating mix of mysticism and legend whilst adding a dose of modern day cynical exploitation (they get paid over $500,000 for their relocation \"fee\") and as the story moves along you wouldn't want to be a chicken - or a pig, either! The largely dark and wet scenarios work well with the sparing usual of visual effects and a strong ensemble performance that keeps the story of dreams and nightmares moving along well for 2¼ hours of well made and at times quite scary ancient horror.",

At ten minutes shy of three hours the story just isn't substantial enough to sustain it and I must confess to finding my attention dwindling a bit at various stages of the proceedings. Thankfully, Geoffrey Rush has rejoined the cast as the whole ensemble must now risk life and limb - and sail to the very edge of the world - to save \"Jack\" (Johnny Depp) from oblivion and thwart the seemingly unstoppable \"Lord Beckett\" (Tom Hollander). How to do this? Well they must galvanise the entire global pirate community and that means the dreaded \"Sao Feng\" (Chow Yun-Fat), \"Capt. Teague\" (the one and only Keith Richards) and a consortium of the most corrupt, venal and treacherous folks ever put on Earth. This time, though, it is \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) who steps up to the plate and demonstrates that she has come a long way since she was kidnapped from her father's home just a few short years ago to become a true kick-ass captain in her own right. This has much less of a story than the first two films; it sort of rehashes the tail end of the story from \"Dead Man's Chest\" (2006) just a bit too much and although the visual effects are superb, as usual, the whole thing just looked more like a victory for the marketing executives than the creative ones at Disney. The last half hour is all good fun, though, with a denouement that we could have had half an hour earlier and that would have served as a fitting conclusion to the adventures of this disparate band of pirates, lovers and scaly monsters. It's still watchable, but I fear this is all a bit tired and Verbinski et al are really struggling for that innovation that we have seen before.",

Once there they find themselves the prey of someone, something, that has ninja skills to die for - and, well, they do!

He manages to use well, the claustrophobic environment; the heat-sensitive camera work is effective and the ascending sense of menace as these hardened men gradually realise that they are out of their depth is gripping. It builds tensely to a denouement that even has a degree of honour to it. Nope, of course the writing is never going to win a Pulitzer, nor is the acting offering us interestingly nuanced or delicate performances.

It follows the story of the ambitious \"Ernest\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle \"King\" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, \"Mollie\" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, \"Ernest\" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more \"suitable\" owners. This sudden spate of \"accidents\" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious \"White\" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the \"King\" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - \"Mollie\" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the \"white\" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better \"Irishman\" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",

A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. \"Namor\" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk.

The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting \"Talokan\" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the \"Superbowl\" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (\"Ross\" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!",

With Depp putting his heart and soul into his character, we incorporate some of Danny Elfman's more entertaining music into a journey of self discovery and millions of calories. It's a quickly paced, lively, enterprise with Tim Burton bringing his technicolour imagination alive for almost two hours. The most engaging effort has to come from Deep Roy who just oozes cheeky charisma as the Oompa-Loompa (well, quite a few of them) who does all the heavy lifting while the guy in the purple velvet takes the credit. It's enjoyable enough, just lacking in that something special.",

Undeterred, she witnesses a terrible storm that washes the young prince \"Eric\" (Jonah Hauer-King) overboard. She races to his rescue and leaves him to his people on the beach - both are already in love! On hearing of her latest transgression, dad is now truly furious and loses his temper driving his daughter into the manipulative tentacles of the evil sea witch \"Ursula\" (Melissa McCarthy) who offers her a bargain - three days on land to obtain true love's kiss or a lifetime in her service. Snag? Well, she will not have her beautiful voice, she will be a mute. A combination of magic, duplicity and serendipity plays it's hand now and she ends up close to the prince, having adventures with him and falling even deeper in love - but can she get her kiss? Will the wicked \"Ursula\" let her? First things first - this isn't a patch on the 1989 version. It has a clunky, over-produced, musical theatre feel to it that consists of mediocre acting and some serious over-scoring. The delicacy and charm of the characterisations and songs has been subjected to grand orchestrations and whilst Bailey can certainly sing, the delivery is more about her ability to belt out the songs rather to than imbue them with any emotions relevant to the charm of the story. McCarthy is quite effective - if only she would stay still for five seconds and that leads to the other disappointment with this film. It works perfectly as an animation - why introduce elements of live-action to it? Neither the story nor the film benefit from the cluttering mix of CGI and real visuals. As with the recent remake of \"The Lion King\", the song lyrics, for reasons that don't seem clear to me, have been reworked - this time by the always over-rated Lin-Manuel Miranda whose \"Scuttlebutt\" song is just plain annoying. It wasn't broke - why fix it? At times there is a little engaging chemistry between Bailey and Hauer-King, but for the most part this is an unnecessary, and overly long, rehash of a fairy tale that seems to me to have been made because it could be, not because it should have been. Disappointing.",

One of the great advantages of the whole \"Spiderman\" concept is that it can be reinvented time and time again without really compromising the original character - a decent but lonely young man trying to make his way in the world and to get his girl. Like Tobey Maguire before him, the casting of the largely unknown Andrew Garfield works well - it allows a whole new generation of fans to follow their hero. The fact that he is cute in tights doesn't do him any harm either. Emma Stone is quite good, too, as the object of his affections \"Mary Jane\" and the whole look of the film is sophisticated and colourful. The story is very derivative, however - and that is the problem with this film. Though there is plenty of action, it becomes a little repetitive and uninspired. The CGI will always look good, and will increasingly do most of the work with these kind of films - indeed, just about everything in the Marvel Universe is 90% style over substance; but so long as they can still recruit enthusiastic actors to play the roles than the franchise might still have legs (though hopefully not eight) for the future. Martin Sheen and Sally Field add a little gravitas to the proceedings - the former has one of these wonderful Churchillian style voices that just goes on resonating, and Rhys Ifans makes for an OK mad scientist. As a stand alone adventure this works fine. Maybe a bit too long, but a cinema experience to be relished - then, maybe, just put away again for seven years.",

To that end, the previously long-suffering cast have been allowed to hang up their screwdrivers and a new set of characters have been drafted in. They are led by \"Cade\" (an enthusiastic Mark Wahlberg). Now he just happens to buy an old truck and it just happens to turn out to be the long lost \"Optimus Prime\". Of course, there are still agencies hunting for the robots and soon he and daughter \"Tessa\" (Nicola Peltz Beckham) are on the run from a militia controlled by the manipulative industrialist \"Joyce\" (Stanley Tucci). Quite why it needs to take 2¾ hours to get to the standard denouement is anyone's guess. Despite the inclusion of some Tyrannosaur-bots, the film has the same relentless predictability as the \"Autobots\" and \"Decepticons\" (if you can spot the difference) go through the same repetitively staged combat scenes before an ending that relies unduly on human intervention (oh yes, and lots of sentimentality too) before we essentially start back at square one with the usual \"Optimus\" monologue concluding the proceedings. This has the added benefit of a truly terrible performance from the always over-rated Kelsey Grammer who had a few, entirely futile, goes at being a cinema baddie and unlike the other films which had a semblance of internationalism to them, this is now an entirely American affair that just bored me.

They have discovered that no harm can be done if they stick to a time limit, exceed that - and well they are in virgin and potentially perilous territory. Following on from her best friend \"Jade\" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to \"Mia\" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young \"Riley\" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle. There's too much dialogue and it's very very score-heavy which did annoy after a while, but it's at times quite scary and definitely worth a watch around Halloween on the telly.",

An added bonus for our hungry visitors is a local community of humans ripe for the eating.

He's an incompetent coward, but he also happens to be the nephew of the state governor, so tends to get away with his obnoxiousness towards the prisoners. That nasty behaviour becomes more pronounced when the giant \"Coffey\" (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives. Also newly arrived is a small mouse which befriends, much to the chagrin of \"Percy\", a fellow inmate (Harry Dean Stanton) and oddly enough it seems to help keep the peace as people come and go. Things take quite an intriguing turn when some physical contact between their gentle giant and \"Edgecomb\" seems to cure his liver complaint. As the officer realises that this man may well possess healing hands, he and his team begins to bond with him. Meantime, the ghastly little \"Percy\" screws up his first execution causing an effect straight out of a Wes Craven film and Sam Rockwell's psychopathic \"Wild Bill\" arrives to liven things up. It's actually Rockwell who steal this for me. His performance is viscerally effective and he really does commit to the role. It's over 3 hours long but the acting is almost perfect as these characters develop and the story unfolds reconciling the brutality of racism, crime and punishment with the attempts at humanity and decency applied by virtually everyone whose lives are touched by these scenarios - even amongst the staff who struggle at times to keep their own priorities in kilter. One of Stephen King's much better stories with depth to the personas, a good baddie to loathe and a message of redemption delivered subtly but powerfully.",

Her persistent hassling of the Vatican for permission - and funds - has finally wound them up to the point where she is invited to Rome to be finally told no. Even there, though, she's sticking to her guns and after a persuasive audience with Pope Leo XIII (Giancarlo Giannini) manages to get permission to prove her worth - only in New York! To it's slum and run-down Five Points district she is sent and what now begins is an adventure that tests her very mettle as the, at best indifferent, attitude of the Archbishop (David Morse) is more concerned with appeasing the Mayor (John Lithgow) than facilitating her wishes for profound change. It's curious that in a city founded by immigrants there existed such a polarity of the Italian, the Jewish and Irish communities offering little, if any, tolerance of the other. Cabrini realises that neither her religion nor her status as a nun is going to help her - she is going to have to recruit local urchins and fight for every scrap of progress. It's history, so we do know what ultimately happens but Alejandro Monteverde has produced a classy looking portrait that still imbues enough jeopardy into the proceedings as she struggles. Her single-minded determination, her bloody-mindedness - all tempered with huge amounts of humanity and decency are well portrayed here. This is a very good looking film, and the narrative also demonstrates clearly the diminished role of women in what purported to be an open and democratic society - American and Italian, and a class system that cared little for those who lived on the wrong side of the tracks. It's a bit long - there are moments that slow the pace down and drag the story, but in the main this is a poignant telling of the story of a woman who was prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary for those less privileged.",

Anyway, apart from that there are loads of endearing characters here from the vegetarian sharks, the loveable \"Peach\" and the characterisation of \"Nemo\" imbues him with an innocence and mischievousness that has to raise a smile - and even engender a bit of concern - as he seems destined for transit in the same plastic bags we all used to use for our goldfish back in the day.

She takes us back to how they met, and of her nervousness about mixing with this outwardly aggressive fraternity, but as she gets to know them and they her, she begins to understand they are no threat, and that in many ways are all the family the others will have/need. As time moves on, though, the \"Vandals\" become a victim of their own success and a proliferation of chapels emerges, introducing a younger more venal and violent element to challenge the existing status quo. Using the stresses and strains of their relationship as a bedrock for the chronology, we follow the ups and downs of this disparate gang and their leader. Sadly, this isn't really a film that catches fire. It's based on real characters, and upon the book written by Danny Lyon, but \"The Wild One\" (1953) it isn't. It's often as if we are just a small fly on the wall observing their day to day routines and dependencies, but we never really get to know the characters. Comer does fine, but she really serves as little better than the narrator rather than an impassioned character increasingly concerned for her husband's wellbeing. There's also precious little dialogue from either Butler or Hardy and the rigid structure of the drama makes it quite hard to empathise with any of them, really. There is also a dearth of action here. For all the bikes, leather and testosterone we are left with just one or two scenes that raise the pulse a little - and they have been well exploited already in the trailing for the film.

Sadly, there's nothing at all original throughout the rest of this pretty dull action thriller that relies too heavily on a slightly comedic narration (his thoughts) guiding us through some set-piece and repetitious combat scenes that after about fifteen minutes left us in no doubt as to the conclusion we were headed for. The more heavily armed soldiers you have guarding something, the easier it is for one man to... The arrival of Michelle Dockery and the sparingly used Famke Janssen add nothing at all, indeed the former is actually pretty terrible and doesn't become any more menacing just because she takes on a mid-Atlantic drawl. It's a fight/stunt co-ordinators' wet dream this film, but for the rest if us it's \"Hunger Games\" light. Very light.",

There's an uncanny resemblance with the blonde floppy hair and the rather linear facial expressions. Indeed, despite a promising (if frustrating) shower scene at the top of the film, Blyth (\"Coryo\") is really what drags this otherwise quite decent action adventure film down. Rachel Zegler, on the other hand, is full of enthusiasm as her \"Lucy Gray\" character is selected to fight for District 12 in the \"Hunger Games\". Meantime, \"Dean Highbottom\" (the infrequently used Peter Dinklage) has come up with a way to spike the dwindling television ratings. He has decided to allocate one of his top students to mentor each of the captives. Yep - \"Coryo\" is put with \"Lucy Gray\". A bit of sabotage changes the nature of the game and gradually our hero starts to wonder if he is on the right side - especially when he becomes a little too emotionally involved with his protégé and attracts the enmity of his own erstwhile mentor. Luckily, the whole scenario is being overseen by the hammily menacing \"Volumnia Gaul\" (Viola Davis) who is clearly having a ball with industrial scale make up and a barrel of genetically modified snakes. The last twenty minutes smacks a little too much of sequel building, but this film has plenty of action and intrigue, loads of back-stabbing and just a little moralising. Zegler delivers a few folky style ballads confidently and generally does a lively enough job keeping it quite a bit better than I was expecting. It needs a cinema, though - the grand scale effects and photography work best that way. On the television it will probably just come across as a bit derivative.",

                "review": "There's a powerful little low-budget effort with Ralph Richardson called \"The Silver Fleet\" (1943) that illustrates just how difficult it was for those in the occupied territories to continue to do what was right without looking like a collaborator and/or ending up against a wall of Nazi bullets. Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager \"Stern\" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children's small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler's gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson's considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3¼ hours long? Well I'm not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score. It's definitely a big screen occasion - somehow television reduces it's impact, so if you can see it in a cinema. Either way, it does offer some salutary lessons in man's inhumanity, and humanity to our fellow man!",

Nothing about the acting nor the writing stand out here and the usual dysfunctional familial dynamic does nothing for the story either.

Writer Tina Fey appears as the calculus teacher but fails to impact much as the thing just meanders along ticking every box and beating just about every stereotype to death before the anthesis of all things obnoxious - a spring \"prom\" - brings things to an inevitable conclusion.

Scorsese takes him time with this story: the development of the characters - their personalities, trust, inter-reliance, sometimes divided, fractured, loyalties and ruthlessness and are built up in a thoroughly convincing fashion. We can, ourselves, see the obvious attractions for the young \"Henry\" of a life so very far removed from his working class Irish-Italian background - the wine, the women, the thrills; it's tantalising! If anything let's it down it's the last half hour; it's just a little too predictable and having spent so long building up the characters, we seem to be in just a bit too much of a rush; but that is a nit-pick.

His attempts to expand, and to a certain extent legitimise, the family businesses see him associating with the duplicitous \"Hyman Roth\" (Lee Strasberg) in Cuba; subject to betrayal, assassination attempts and fighting what may be a losing battle to keep his own family together - all whilst doing plenty of Machiavellian manipulation of his own. There is an equally strong parallel thread depicting how his father \"Vito\" (Robert de Niro) rose to prominence after fleeing Sicily after the murder of his family at the hands of \"Don Ciccio\". With the principal characters all now well established, we can hit the ground running with a solid and complex set of inter-connected, character-driven storylines. The superior cast deliver this story really effectively - Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton as the consigliere and wife respectively, standing out. The attention to detail alongside the instantly recognisable Nino Rota score add amply to what is just a great story of Michael's efforts to build upon (and honour) his father's legacy, before he loses all of his own, once prevailing, decency. It is long, and it does miss Brando, but Pacino is on super form as the increasingly ruthless and isolated - even lonely - figure and I reckon this is every bit as good at the \"Godfather\" (1972).",

Can they rally and save the day before carnage ensues and mankind is wiped out? Nope, not a shred of jeopardy here - but the two hours just flew by. It's fun. It's not trying to offer us any grand philosophies, or complex time-shifting science. It's a lightly comedic adventure film that rarely stops for breath, uses state of the art special effects to enhance the story rather than dominate it, and by the end I was ready to remember why I quite enjoyed the original from 2019. All of this said, I fear they will try to squeeze a third from the franchise and think that would be an error. This works because of some charismatic performances - particularly from the rather engaging Jack Dylan Grazer as the lovestruck \"Freddy\"; a great big dragon and an at times quite pithy script. Please let's leave well alone now?",

The pace and tension build really well - helped by some good use of sound and light (I didn't much care for the over-synthesised score), the supporting screams from PJ Soles and Nancy Kyes and the occasional intervention from Pleasence. The sequels never reached the heights of this, original psychological horror - there are precious few special effect to laugh at or even speak of, really - and if you get a chance to catch up with it as intended on 35mm then you should certainly give it a go.",

Worryingly, though, he is spotted there by toy museum owner \"McWiggin\" and is promptly kidnapped!

There are now plenty of fun escapades for all concerned to keep this high quality animation entertaining. That said, I don't really do sentimentality, and I found this to be a little more so than the first one. The introduction of \"Jessie\" accompanied by the rather sad story of her abandonment (set to an equally sad song) did drag the pace down a bit for me, but when the action kicks in again, then we revert to a first-rate, team-driven and wittily written tale of camaraderie, loyalty and ingenuity. Messrs. Hanks, Allen and Rickles keep up their established good work, this time joined by Joan Cusack and an on form Kelsey Grammer as \"Prospector\". It could be argued that the first \"Toy Story\" film was a marketing man's wet dream; this second feature is very nearly as good and demonstrates the enduring and engaging nature of the characters who value each other above all.

                "review": "Seems to be a growing trend nowadays to lead with the credentials of the director in order to get eyeballs onto a movie. That's what seems to have happened here, but once you're watching it turns out to be little better than a derivative vehicle for an unremarkable Jake Gyllenhaal who gets to tug at the heart strings on behalf of those vital interpreters (50,000 of them, apparently) who were abandoned to the Taliban when the allied forces quit Afghanistan. In this rather procedural effort, his guide \"Ahmed\" (Dar Salim) goes above and beyond to rescue his handler \"Kinley\" from ambush only to find that the American is flown home to safety, recuperation and a big steak on the barbecue. The latter man is left to reap the benefits of his sterling efforts by having a price on his head and so is forced to live in hiding. \"Kinley\" learns of this and decides that the man must be got out. After endless red tape seems determined to ensure that the promise made at the time to these folks to offer them fast-track American visas after the conflict was not going to be honoured any time soon, \"KInley\" decides he's going to have to take matters into his own hands. Remarkably, from his American home he manages to track down the elusive \"Ahmed\" and with the aid of a commercial extraction agency, funds a trip to get in and get his friend out. Aside from some serious plot plausibility issues, as action films go it's fine. The cinematography and pace work well to give us a sense of the danger and the relentlessness (and stealth) of the warfare that frequently nullifies the superior firepower of the visitors when faced with hostile terrain and efficient guerrilla warriors. Gyllenhaal does nothing for me here, though. He's just going through the motions, especially when required to actually act. He has become a rather one-dimensional performer (maybe it's the beard?) and though there is merit in Salim's performance as his character is allowed to mature a little by Guy Ritchie, I just felt that I'd seen the film before and the underpinning moralisation was largely undermined by the predictability of the storyline. It's certainly watchable, but it isn't hard to see why it never got a cinema release.",

Alone, that is until a kindly Dianne Wiest (\"Peg\") takes him under her wing, introduces him to her many friends - including an on-form Winona Ryder (\"Kim\") - and they all discover he has a remarkable ability for topiary (and hairdressing!). Soon he is all the rage, the talk of the town - but always the misfit, and of course when a mishap - in this case a robbery for which he is framed - occurs, his fickle friends turn on him readily. It's a touching tale of innocence and humanity; Depp plays his role skilfully and with delicacy and humour, and the last half hour is quite a damning indictment of thoughtlessness and selfishness that still resonates today. Like many \"fairy\" tales, it has it's root in decent morals and Tim Burton is ahead of the game in delivering a nuanced and enjoyable modern day parable that makes you laugh, smile and wince with shame in equal measure.",

This action immediately earns him the enmity of the now fired captain \"Danglars\" (Patrick Mille) and then just as his joy is to be complete with his marriage to \"Mercedes\" (Anaïs Demoustier) the soldiers arrive and he's implicated in a Napoleonic plot! The prosecutor, \"de Villefort\" (Laurent Lafitte) appears sympathetic and accepts his pleas of innocence, but when his close friend \"Morcef\" (Bastien Bouillon) is called upon to vouch for \"Dantès\" his own envious agenda takes hold and next, our naive young seaman is heading to the solitude of the Chateau D'If from which prisoners never escape. As the years of relentless frustration and boredom go by, his only conversation is a regular call from his jailers to see if he's still alive. Then a miracle occurs. Another prisoner has been tunnelling for years and inadvertently breaks through to his cell. It's this man - the Abbé Faria (Pierfrancesco Favino) - who gives him more than a little education as they try to dig their way to the sea wall. It's not to be for both, though, but armed with a knowledge that could change his life for ever, he manages to trick the guards and make it to land. It's now that the story of revenge hots up as we jump forward a few years and are introduced to the eponymous Count. He travels in style, has great wealth and style and is determined to avenge himself on the three men who framed him. As with himself, these men have gone on to great things with his denouncing friend now married to his love, \"Danglars\" owning a great trading fleet and the prosecutor now a powerful state official. \"Dantès\" has used his time well, assembling some allies whose roles in this unfolding drama are gradually revealed to us as politics, greed and jealousy stride to the fore of this classically designed production. The lavish costumes, stately homes and opulence of their lives contrasts well with the poverty and ruin faced by those collaterally damaged by the ambitions of men who cared but for themselves, and for whom our dashing and calculation gazillionaire is gunning. Nimey (who occasionally looked a bit like Kevin Kline here?) delivers that wronged and now Machiavellian characterisation especially well. There are also strong efforts from the younger characters \"Albert\" (Vassili Schneider); \"André\" (Julien De Saint Jean) and \"Haydée\" (Anamaria Vartolomei). It's essentially a thoroughly potent story of revenge, but it's as much about just how that can become a toxic influence that can eat into a man's soul and the challenge for \"Dantès\" and those around him whom he loves - however unwillingly on the surface - is not to become an obsessed demon every bit as ghastly as those he wishes to punish. It's this slow, dripping, evolution that the film delivers enthrallingly as we see this troubled man tread an increasingly conflicted line between love and hate. Revenge is said to be a dish best served cold, but like most things served cold - it doesn't keep for long.",

Before you start watching, do bear in mind that JM Barrie created the \"Peter Pan\" character at the very start of the 20th century, so some of the language and roles are a touch on the stereotypical side - but that ought not to unduly spoil this experience. The \"Darlings\" are a loving, but pretty dysfunctional family with a huge great dog \"Nana\" whose three children all share the nursery in the attic of the family home. \"Peter\" visits and with the help of his friendly sprite \"Tinker Bell\" takes the youngsters on a series of magical adventures in \"Never Land\" where nobody ever grows up. The legendary \"Captan Hook\" is his local adversary, hell bent on repaying \"Peter\" for causing him to lose his hand to a crocodile who is equally determined to eat the rest of him! There's a bit of depth to the characterisations - the story might be a \"love\" story; but it is certainly one that introduces loyalty, trust, jealousy and comradeship to youngsters in a thoroughly engaging, plausible way. There is plenty of action too - a wonderful sword fight; lots of flying and the carefree attitude of the children is really quite contagious. The animation is once again, expertly hand-crafted, with vivid colours that help convey a lot of the joy of the film.

Understood that you erect a 2000ft television relay tower back in the day, but when that industry moves to satellite delivery, why on Earth would anyone just leave this gradually rusting structure standing - only for it to come crashing down one day when the metal fatigue has won out? Hmmm! Anyway, luckily for us the planner's ineptitude allowed for \"Becky\" (Grace Caroline Currey) and her friend \"Hunter\" (Virginia Gardner) to go climb it. It's quite a big deal for the former woman - she had been free-climbing almost one year earlier with her friend and her husband \"Dan\" (Mason Gooding) when disaster struck and she has spent much of the intervening period married to Jack Daniels. Scorning any sensible planning - food, gloves etc. up they go - there is a ladder - and are soon at the top surveying the immensity of the view. Time to go down, the ladder gives way. The two are lucky to have the platform right at the top to take refuge on, but their bag - water and drone contained within - falls 50 feet and balances precariously on a redundant satellite dish below. What's to do? The plot really does take a quite cynical turn when they fire a flare to attract the attention of some men in a nearby camper van, only for the guys to spot them and then proceed to steal their car! Otherwise, this is really just a remarkable feat of photography that certainly had my palms sweating. Director Scott Mann and the cinematographer (MacGregor) do manage to effectively draw us into the two friend's predicament and if you are even vaguely acrophobic, then this film can be a really tough watch at times. Sadly, though, in the search for characterisation we discover that even at altitude, there is a place for a rather tiresome melodrama. Thereafter it is quite difficult to warm to either of the women who are being harried by some hungry buzzards as they perch! The ending is not good. To be fair, it isn't straightforward either, it has a few quirks to keep us on our toes - but they are not terribly realistic quirks. Enjoy is not the correct word for this film - I cannot say I was too relaxed for much of my time in the cinema tonight, but if this is to be seen at all, then it does need that big screen. On television it will lose much of it's photographic impact and that really is all this film is worth watching for - the acting and repetitive \"Are you OK?\" dialogue leaves much to be desired.",

Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to \"Jenny\" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company.  She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother \"Jaime\" (Xolo Maridueña) with strict instructions not to even open the box. Of course they do, and next thing he and the glowing blue gizmo are best mates - he can fly, zip around with great speed and has, of course, super-human strength. \"Cord\" is determined to get it back, so she energises her already semi-mechanised henchman \"Carapax\" (Raoul Max Trujillo) for a gradual/glacial build up to a denouement that a bat could see from space. This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle \"Rudy\" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad. This is a weak story with a weak cast that seems designed to fill a gap in the USA's expanding and under-served Hispanic market. I think it may work there? I'm not so sure anyone else needs this.",

The slasher manages to penetrate tight security; be in half a dozen places at one time; have access to secret phone numbers etc...; whilst those impaled appear to have a remarkable resilience for survival and recovery after an onslaught that would have felled an elephant. That's not the point, though. Unlike so many of the genre, this is actually quite scary and works well as a bit of a self-parody. If you've watched the others in the franchise, you will know how the dynamic plays out - and this is just an extension of that. The story doesn't really matter - it's the way in which the directors manage to imbue the whole thing with an entertaining degree of menace and paranoia, a few quite effective jump moments and by using a cast of relative non-entities (and by only using the wooden as a draining-board Courteney Cox sparingly), they manage to create a film that is actually a bit frightening at times. There are plenty of new characters for us to suspect including love interest Josh Segarra (\"Danny\") - who reminded me of Christian Bale, and the rather hapless Jack Champion's (\"Ethan\") before an ending that was, admittedly, quite ridiculous! This is not a film that will engage your brain on any level, but as piece of well constructed entertainment with some frequently quite witty dialogue and an eye watering encounter between a boy and a taser - it's well worth catching up with.",

                "review": "Morgan Freeman is the veteran detective \"Somerset\" who is saddled with the newly married rookie \"Mills\" (Brad Pitt) and sent to investigate quite possibly the most ghastly murder scene cinema has ever produced. A man has been force-fed beans until he, quite literally, burst! A missing slither of kitchen floor lino suggests the fridge had recently been moved and behind that they find a clue - one that suggests this man had committed one of the deadly sins (gluttony) and therefore it's reasonable to assume that six more, equally heinous, killings may follow. Indeed when they start to doc just that, both detectives must hastily learn to work together - despite their contrasting approaches to police work - if they are to piece together the evidence. What makes matters worse for the pair, is that they begin to suspect that they are the metaphorical ball of wool for the killer's cat. They get closer and closer, but are always just that little bit late as this self-appointed weapon of god seems to be being wielded with every more horrific killing. David Fincher allows both actors here to develop this mystery compellingly, with a sparing but potent dialogue and an almost perfectly paced and scored progress as we all know what must come last - but never will we anticipate just how the coup de gras will be delivered. This is one of these superior crime dramas that leaves a little more to think about each time I watch it. Really good.",

We start with a battle from history where the defeated \"Ashwatthama\" is condemned to a life of fruitless immortality. His only chance of redemption will come when he is called upon to protect an unborn child - the final reincarnation of Vishnu. At this point we don't know when this will happen, nor what these dangers might be - but skip forward six thousand years and we find a world where the planet is under the control of the \"Complex\". An alien looking enterprise that is systematically robbing the planet of it's nutrients and minerals under the control of the \"Supreme Yaskin\" (Kamal Haasan). Things are especially perilous times for women capable of childbearing as they are being genetically manipulated to produce a serum from their foetus that is implanted into \"Yaksin\" to grant him his own form of (tube free) immortality. Meantime, we are introduced to the legendary bounty hunter \"Bhairava\" (Prabhas) who has something of the \"Han Solo\" to him, and who is working to get the million credits required to get into the \"Complex\". There is one further enigma amongst all of this ordered chaos. She is \"Sum 80\" (Deepika Padukone) as she is pregnant - and naturally, too. Needless to say she is much prized by the \"Complex\" but after some careful planning, she manages to escape the clutches of it's scientists and make a break for \"Shambala\" where legend has it, she will give birth to a very special baby. In hot pursuit is the malevolent commander \"Manas\" (Saswata Chatterjee) who has mobilised an whole army of unsavoury types to track her down - and with a prize of 5 million for the person who delivers her, well \"Bhairava\" is soon in on the chase too. If he can help this woman, perhaps \"Ashwatthama\" can fulfil his destiny? Now this is long, and at times it loses it's way a little with the oddly positioned entertainment numbers spliced into the drama, but for the most part - particularly after the interval - this is quite an action packed hybrid of Hindu folklore combined with elements of \"Dune\" (especially much of the scoring), \"Avatar\" and featuring a guest appearance from \"Skeletor's\" big chair from \"Masters of the Universe\" towards the end. I wouldn't have said the acting is all that remarkable, but Prabhas provides a charismatic effort, the dialogue generally works efficiently and the production design is creatively effective at mixing the futuristic with the ancient. There's no getting away from it's reliance on CGI, and that doesn't always work, but the story is sound and clearly designed to give us more down the line as the ancient gods line up against the pillagers of the planet - with the very future of mankind to play for.",

Her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, \"007\"-style agent perplexes her mother, though. What happens next? Well wait til book six would seem to be the obvious answer, but mom (Catherine O'Hara) insists so \"Elly\" decides to take train to visit her parents - and that's mistake number one. Onboard she encounters a rather scruffy looking chap \"Wilde\" (Sam Rockwell) who is reading one of her books. She tries to hide her identity, but when he gets to the fly-leaf then her secret is out. That's soon the least of her worries as she and travelling cat \"Alfie\" are soon caught up in something straight out of one of her books! She can't fathom why she'd conceivably be the target for any nasty people, but her new found friend soon convinces her that there is someone she has to meet - and pretty quickly she's embroiled in an whole new world of mystery, intrigue and danger! It's a bit of a slow start this film, with a slightly annoying flicking between her real life and those of her characterisations (that's where the \"Action Man\" style of the sparingly used Henry Cavill appears) but once we establish who is who and what's going on, we are straight into \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" territory with loads of rapid-fire escapades that though hardly original, do have some fun twists and turns as we progress to a denouement that is derivative, but still quite enjoyable to watch. The initial concept is quite original and though the execution largely an amalgam of other Matthew Vaughn features, it still works quite well even if it is far too long, with Rockwell clearly having some fun here and the cat remaining largely contained in it's capsule throughout!",

Anyway, off he goes to Mexico and then quickly discovers that it was all a con. A really cynical con at that, and so he decides that some gruesome revenge is due on the team that dreamt up this atrocious scheme. What now ensues is one of the best horror thrillers I've seen for ages. The assembled \"medical\" team find themselves tracked down, apprehended and then attached to some fairly ghastly devices in a sort of brutal version of the \"Adventure Game\". Great sacrifices are going to have to be made if any of them are to survive! Further complications follow when another victim of their scam - \"Parker\" (Steven Brand) turns up bent on his own kind of revenge... It's violent and brutal, this film, but we are spared the very worst of the graphic imagery and that actually helps us to do our own visualising as limbs start coming adrift. There's not a great deal of dialogue, which is good, and the score doesn't resort to the creation of jump moments for us - that's all left to our eyes and our imagination. There's a twist at the end but it's rather weak and does rather let the thing down a little. All told, though, this is very much at the better end of recent films in this genre and in a dark cinema is well worth two hours.",

Meantime Zeus is celebrating the birth of a baby boy. Hades decides to strike back, but his augurs (the \"Fates\" but think more \"Stygian witches\") advise that this little boy - Hercules - is the fly in the ointment who must be neutralised if his grand design is to succeed. Hades tricks him firstly into mortality and then cons him out of his great strength - but will that be enough to defeat the determination of our hero? It is a bit of a slow starter; but once it gets into the swing there are some good performances from James Woods (superb as Hades), Rip Torn (Zeus) and Danny DeVito as the long-suffering demi-god trainer \"Phil\" that keep this fantasy adventure moving along nicely.

It seems the folks need the dam, though, and after a bit of toing and froing, they manage to convince the apes to allow them to try to make the dynamos work - before what's left of their city runs out of power. This uneasy truce has opponents on both sides, but it's the scheming \"Koba\" (Toby Kebbell) who finally takes a step that ensures that war cannot be avoided. Which will win out in the end? Will either side actually win at all? Matt Reeves plays his cards really well here. He manages the sense of menace between the two parties with an expert hand, allowing the initial feelings of partnership and hope that turn into fear, betrayal and malevolence to enthral us. The characterisations - especially amongst those long fed up of living at the whim of humanity - deliver effectively too. \"Koba\" exudes an almost evil persona, an unscrupulousness and ruthlessness that would make the original Caesar blush. The photography is cleverly directed using the ruined urban and similarly dense forest scenarios to add richness and peril to the pyrotechnics, the superbly authentic looking visual effects and the general look of violence and chaos that descends as the film reaches what is clearly just the end of part one. It's a solid, characterful, story that isn't necessarily an improvement on the originals, but is certainly a strong and worthy successor.",

A political assassinations has destabilised the kingdom and so \"General Noble\" (Ed Skrein) is off in his Dreadnought to terrorise the inter-planetary population.

What we have now are a series predicable, set-piece, escapades as gradually they assemble a disparate band of rogues and criminals who might just want to take on the general in an hopelessly one-sided contest. You might detect the voice of Sir Anthony Hopkins (\"Jimmy\") and Charlie Hunnam sports a variable Irish accent as the famed \"Kai\" as this follows extremely well trammelled lines of adventure mixed with romance, political intrigue and some whizzo special effects. The denouement is straight out of \"Attack of the Clones\" (2002) and sets us up for a second instalment that you could probably just about map out now. I like the genre and I didn't hate the film, but it's disappointingly derivative and - well, you've just seen it all before.",

Benedict Cumberbatch is really just reprising his BBC \"Sherlock\" characterisation - even down to the pensive hand gestures.

The underlying moralising is all the same as usual - teamwork, loneliness, love and the values of family and sharing, but Dean DeBlois manages to dress that all up cleverly with plenty of enjoyable escapades, some frequently pithy one-liners and even the slightest hint of menace from the Grand Councilwoman who must have been inspired by Glenn Close!

                "review": "This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. To preface, I want to clarify that I know nothing about the Borderlands video games—I’ve never played them, and I have no bias against them. However, I approached this movie with some trepidation, knowing Eli Roth's track record with handling other IPs has been less than stellar.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Borderlands feels like a blatant attempt to rip off Guardians of the Galaxy. The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians so special. Borderlands is one dance-off scene short of being a direct copy, but even if Roth had included a dance-off, he probably would have cast an Australian Olympic breakdancer—an ill-fitting choice emblematic of how off-target this film is.\r\n\r\nThe movie throws the audience into a barrage of nonsensical twists and turns that lack coherence or purpose. The narrative seems to be constantly shifting, yet never in a way that feels organic or meaningful. The lack of a coherent plot makes it difficult to stay invested, and the film quickly becomes tedious.\r\n\r\nAnother glaring issue is the film's failure to create any meaningful connection between its main characters. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the chemistry among the team is a driving force, making their adventures feel both exciting and emotionally resonant. In contrast, Borderlands completely misses this mark. The characters are paper-thin, with little to no development, and their interactions lack the spark needed to make the audience care about their journey.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film also disappoints. The aesthetic choices, from the set design to the visual effects, fail to create a compelling or immersive world. The film’s attempt to capture the wild, chaotic energy of the Borderlands universe falls flat, resulting in a bland and uninspired visual experience. \r\n\r\nOverall, Borderlands is a truly boring movie, devoid of character development, narrative coherence, or visual appeal. It’s a film that not only fails to honor the spirit of its source material but also fails to stand on its own as an entertaining piece of cinema. Eli Roth’s attempt to capture the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in a forgettable and frustrating experience. This movie serves as a reminder that simply mimicking successful formulas without understanding what makes them work is a recipe for disaster.",

                "review": "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",

                "review": "I didn’t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn’t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film’s core strengths—its characters and story—remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you’ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",

                "review": "I was hooked by the premise of Trap from the moment I saw the trailer. The idea of a serial killer bringing his daughter to a Taylor Swift-like concert, only for it to be a police trap to capture him, immediately grabbed my attention. I’ve always enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan’s films, particularly when he reveals the twist right from the beginning. With Josh Hartnett in the role of the serial killer, I was eager to see how this intriguing setup would unfold.\r\n\r\nThe premise of Trap is undeniably captivating, setting up a high-stakes thriller from the outset. The concept of a seemingly innocent concert turning into the backdrop for a police sting operation is both original and suspenseful. \r\n\r\nJosh Hartnett delivers a terrific performance, portraying the serial killer with a chilling mix of charisma and cold calculation. His ability to switch between a doting father and a remorseless killer is unsettling and adds layers to his character. For instance, a scene where he interacts lovingly with his daughter moments before revealing his sinister intentions showcases Hartnett’s range and adds to the film’s tension. His portrayal keeps the audience on edge, wondering how far his character will go and how the situation will unravel.\r\n\r\nTrap is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief, as it occasionally stretches the bounds of plausibility. However, if you allow yourself to get lost in the story, the film is an intense thriller from beginning to end. The pacing is well-handled, with the tension building steadily as the plot unfolds.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its share of plot holes and moments that strain credibility. There are a few instances where the suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits, such as the police’s elaborate setup and the killer’s seemingly superhuman ability to evade capture. These elements can be distracting, particularly in the final act, where the film becomes somewhat redundant. The climax, while thrilling, feels repetitive and doesn’t fully capitalize on the strong buildup that precedes it.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, I walked away from Trap having enjoyed it enough to consider watching it again. The film is a fun, intense thriller that keeps you engaged throughout, provided you’re willing to overlook some of its more implausible moments. Josh Hartnett’s performance is a standout, and the film’s unique premise is executed well enough to deliver a satisfying, if not entirely flawless, viewing experience. If you’re a fan of Shyamalan’s work or enjoy thrillers that blend suspense with psychological drama, Trap is worth your time.",

Initially, I didn’t expect much, but by the end, I found myself loving this fun and adventurous film. It has a lot of heart, some good laughs, and is great for parents to take their kids to.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout elements of the movie is the introduction of Garfield’s father, Vic. This addition brings a fresh perspective to the Garfield universe. The dysfunctional father-son dynamic adds depth to the story, making it more engaging. \r\n\r\nThe plot cleverly intertwines this family dynamic with a heist storyline, which adds excitement and keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace. The movie offers plenty of laughs, with jokes that appeal to both kids and adults. The humor is well-timed and varies from slapstick to witty one-liners, ensuring that there is something for everyone.\r\n\r\nOdie, in particular, stands out and truly rocks in this film. His loyal and energetic presence brings a lot of charm to the screen. The chemistry between Garfield and Odie is spot on, providing some of the film’s most memorable moments. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, The Garfield Movie is a delightful surprise and a significant step up from its predecessors. With its heartwarming story, engaging characters, and balanced humor, it’s a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together. The addition of Garfield’s father, Vic, and the dynamic he brings to the story, along with Odie’s standout moments, make this a must-watch for fans of the beloved cat.

Guy Ritchie crafts an intriguing story about Winston Churchill’s team of highly skilled misfit soldiers recruited for the dirtiest missions against the Germans. This film combines historical drama with Ritchie's signature style, resulting in an engaging and action-packed experience.\r\n\r\nHenry Cavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge.\r\n\r\nCavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the subplot involving two Allied spies embedded within the German ranks adds an exciting layer of espionage. Babs Olusanmokun and Eiza González deliver fantastic performances, navigating the perilous environment with a blend of cunning and bravery. \r\n\r\nHowever, not all elements of the film work seamlessly. The scenes featuring Winston Churchill are notably weaker, often disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the film’s intensity. These moments feel out of place, detracting from the otherwise tight and focused storytelling. \r\n\r\nOn the technical front, the film excels with masterful cinematography and outstanding sound design. The visual style captures the gritty and chaotic nature of war while maintaining clarity during intense action sequences. The sound design immerses the audience in the film’s world, from the clamor of battle to the subtle tension of stealth operations. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a compelling addition to the war film genre, distinguished by its strong performances, engaging dual storylines, and technical prowess. While some scenes fall short, particularly those involving Winston Churchill, the film’s overall impact remains powerful. Guy Ritchie’s unique touch brings a fresh perspective to a historical narrative, making this film a must-watch for fans of action, history, and espionage.",

                "review": "I didn’t have high expectations for The Exorcism, and my initial confusion about whether it was a sequel to Russell Crowe's other exorcism movie from last year (The Pope's Exorcist, 2023) didn’t help. However, the first two acts of the film were surprisingly intriguing. The atmosphere and the mysteries being built throughout the story captured my interest, creating a sense of foreboding that kept me engaged.\r\n\r\nThe film does an excellent job of establishing an eerie atmosphere that is both unsettling and captivating. The cinematography and set design contribute to a sense of creeping dread, with dimly lit rooms and shadowy figures that add to the tension. \r\n\r\nRussell Crowe delivers a strong performance as an aging actor who appears to be descending into madness—or possibly possession. His portrayal is nuanced, capturing the uncertainty of a man who doesn’t know if he’s losing his grip on reality or being overtaken by something more sinister. For instance, his interactions with other characters, such as a skeptical priest and a concerned family member, are laced with a growing sense of unease, effectively building the tension. Crowe’s gradual shift from confident to increasingly erratic is one of the film’s highlights.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the film falls apart in the final act. What had been a carefully constructed narrative devolves into chaos, with the story’s conclusion feeling completely disjointed from what came before. The final scenes abandon the atmospheric tension in favor of over-the-top action and special effects, which undermine the psychological horror that had been so carefully built. \r\n\r\nThe ending offers no satisfying resolution because nothing about it makes sense. The carefully crafted mysteries and character development are thrown aside for a conclusion that feels more like a spectacle than a logical progression of the story. This abrupt shift leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and not in a way that invites thoughtful reflection, but rather in a way that feels frustrating and incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe Exorcism joins a long line of exorcism films that have missed the mark. While it starts with promise, building an intriguing atmosphere and strong character dynamics, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive or satisfying narrative. The final act’s departure from the established tone and story structure highlights the film’s inability to maintain the tension and mystery it initially sets up.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Exorcism is a film that had potential but ultimately falters. Russell Crowe’s performance and the initial atmospheric build-up are commendable, but the film’s chaotic and nonsensical final act leaves much to be desired. As another entry in the exorcism genre, it fails to stand out and instead becomes yet another example of a film that starts strong but loses its way, leaving the audience disappointed and disconnected.",

I enjoyed Yorgos Lanthimos's previous film, Poor Things, also starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. In my opinion, that film is a shining star in his filmography. Before that, I found most of his work to be beautiful and intriguing in premise but ultimately very dull. Kinds of Kindness is not just dull but completely boring with no real intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe movie is divided into three separate stories, all revolving around the initials 'R.M.F', which are used by many of the cast playing multiple characters. This narrative structure, intended to interweave various tales of absurd kindness and humanity, fails to deliver a cohesive or engaging storyline. The disjointed nature of these stories makes it difficult to form any emotional connection or investment in the characters' journeys.\r\n\r\nAlthough I found all of the characters in this film just as boring as the movie overall, the ensemble cast does their best to bring distinctiveness to their roles. Each character played by the talented actors has their own nuances, highlighting their skill despite the weak material.\r\n\r\nThe biggest credit goes to the location scouts and art departments for providing beautiful scenery to an otherwise mundane movie.

Unfortunately, this did not change my initial impression. The film remained an exercise in tedium, with no scenes or moments that redeemed its slow pace and uninspired plot.

                "review": "To say that I was excited for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is an understatement. This is without a doubt one of my favorite franchises of all time, even including the less impressive third film. I thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment, which sees an older Axel Foley back in Beverly Hills working a case. This time, he is up against cartels, corrupt cops, and more, led by Kevin Bacon, who threatens his daughter Jane, a Beverly Hills defense attorney.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Axel teams up with a young detective, Bobby, who is also Jane’s ex-boyfriend, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The return of franchise favorites Judge Reinhold as Billy Rosewood, John Ashton as John Taggert, Bronson Pinchot as Serge, and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey adds a layer of nostalgia that fans will appreciate.\r\n\r\nEddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the character of Axel Foley, as easily as putting on his Lions varsity jacket. His performance is both charismatic and energetic, reminding us why this character became an icon. Murphy’s ability to blend humor with action is on full display, particularly in scenes where he outsmarts his adversaries with his trademark wit and cunning.\r\n\r\nThe story is fun and packed with exciting moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart. The chemistry between the original cast members remains perfect and mixes well with the new additions. Kevin Bacon shines as a formidable antagonist, providing a worthy challenge for Axel and his team. His portrayal of a corrupt, menacing figure adds depth to the film’s conflict.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography successfully bridges the gritty feel of the first movies with the more stylistic approach of the second. The action sequences are well-executed, although some of the stunts and gags feel a bit over the top. For example, an elaborate chase scene through the streets of Beverly Hills, while thrilling, stretches the bounds of believability. Additionally, the film’s timeline contains some questionable elements that don’t quite align with the previous entries in the series. These inconsistencies, while minor, can be distracting for long-time fans.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the film’s attempt to incorporate elements from the earlier movies, but I wish Beverly Hills Cop 3 had been integrated more thoughtfully rather than just as a throwaway joke. A more substantial nod to the third film could have added a layer of continuity and depth to the story.\r\n\r\nOverall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a fun action film that fits well with the recent trend of entertaining action movies released this year. It’s impressive how the film manages to capture the spirit of the original while adding fresh elements to keep the story engaging. Eddie Murphy’s return as Axel Foley is a delight, and the film’s blend of humor, action, and heart makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Despite some minor flaws, this movie stands out as a testament to why the Beverly Hills Cop series remains beloved by fans.",

                "review": "Maxxxine is a film I have eagerly anticipated since it was teased as the final installment of Ti West's X trilogy. Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two films, I had high hopes for this one. Each film in the series brings a unique style that represents the period it’s set in.\r\n\r\n2022’s X was a gritty homage to the brutal horror films of the 1970s, with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a major influence. The same year, Pearl offered an even more stylistic approach, serving as a prequel with influences from the silent era and visual nods to The Wizard of Oz. These distinct stylistic choices set a high bar for Maxxxine.\r\n\r\nIn Maxxxine, we follow the lone survivor of the farmhouse massacres depicted in the first film. Now a bit older and blonder, Mia Goth’s Maxine is still striving to become Hollywood’s next biggest star. She finally lands a role as the lead in a new horror film, but her past begins to catch up with her. She is pursued by a sleazy private investigator, played by Kevin Bacon, who works for a vicious killer targeting Maxine’s closest friends. Concurrently, Maxine must navigate the terror of the Night Stalker, who is haunting Los Angeles, while detectives try to unravel her connection to these events.\r\n\r\nMaxxxine is a beautiful love letter to the horror films of the 1980s. Ti West draws influence from many great horror filmmakers of that era. One scene in particular, where Maxine ascends a staircase toward the film’s climax, is reminiscent of the cinematography of David Lynch films from that period. This meticulous attention to style and atmosphere enhances the film’s nostalgic appeal.\r\n\r\nMia Goth is truly fantastic, bringing depth and intensity to her role. Her performance is a highlight of the trilogy, showcasing her versatility as she navigates multiple characters and complex emotional landscapes. For example, her portrayal of Maxine’s relentless determination and underlying vulnerability adds layers to the character, making her journey compelling and relatable.\r\n\r\nWhile Maxxxine is a strong entry in the series, it is, in my opinion, the weakest installment. The film serves as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy but leaves some unresolved threads from X. I would have appreciated more closure regarding the events of the first film, as the connections feel somewhat superficial. Additionally, the reveal of the main antagonist, while surprising, feels somewhat detached from the overarching narrative. For instance, the motivations and background of the killer are not as deeply integrated into the story as they could have been, leading to a somewhat disjointed climax.\r\n\r\nDespite these criticisms, Maxxxine is a well-crafted horror film that offers plenty of nods to genre aficionados. Ti West has created a trilogy that honors the horror tradition while bringing fresh and innovative storytelling to the table. The film is rich with familiarities from 1980s horror, making it a nostalgic yet refreshing experience. Mia Goth’s performance ties the trilogy together beautifully, and her portrayal in Maxxxine cements her status as a standout in modern horror cinema. While the film has its flaws, it remains a fitting and enjoyable conclusion to a remarkable series.",

The atmospheric setting of the forest and the eerie, partially ruined building effectively create a sense of isolation and tension. \r\n\r\nDespite its strong visual elements, the story itself falls short. The plot feels longer than necessary, with certain elements that don’t always make sense. The pacing drags in places, causing the suspense to wane rather than build.\r\n\r\nThe acting is another weak point. The performances come across as stale, with characters making choices that often seem illogical and uninspired. Mina’s interactions with the other stranded individuals lack depth and emotional resonance, making it hard to connect with her plight. The other characters also fail to leave a lasting impression, contributing to the overall sense of disengagement.\r\n\r\nThe themes of isolation and surveillance have the potential to be compelling, but they are not fully realized in this film. The concept of being constantly watched by an unseen force could have been used to create a more intense psychological thriller. However, the execution falls flat, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and unconvincing.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Watchers is a visually striking film that ultimately fails to resonate on a deeper level. While Ishana Night Shyamalan shows promise as a director with her ability to create atmosphere and tension, the film is let down by weak performances, a disjointed story, and lackluster character development. It’s a forgettable film that doesn’t leave a lasting impact. However, I am looking forward to seeing Ishana’s next directorial outing, hoping she can build on her strengths and deliver a more cohesive and engaging film in the future.",

The film heavily relies on celebrity cameos, which, overshadow the story's substance. This overreliance on star power creates a superficial experience that fails to engage the audience meaningfully.\r\n\r\nThe movie attempts to pull on the heartstrings of the audience, but it does so without a satisfying payoff. Emotional scenes feel forced and unearned, lacking the depth necessary to make a lasting impact. \r\n\r\nThe narrative structure is weak. The pacing is uneven, jumping from one celebrity cameo to another without allowing the plot to develop naturally. This results in a fragmented viewing experience that leaves the audience struggling to connect with the characters. \r\n\r\nThe film's attempt to evoke emotion through its storyline falls flat because it doesn’t give enough attention to character development. We see glimpses of potentially interesting backstories, but they are never fully explored. A scene involving a character’s past trauma is introduced but quickly abandoned, leaving the audience with unanswered questions and a sense of incompleteness.\r\n\r\nOverall, IF is a movie that misses the mark. Its reliance on celebrity cameos and superficial emotional appeals results in a lackluster film. To improve, the filmmakers should have focused more on developing a strong, cohesive narrative that allows the characters' stories to resonate deeply with the audience. Without this foundation, the film feels hollow and fails to leave a lasting impression.",

                "review": "This reimagining of the far superior original was an abysmal disappointment. While attempting to build a trilogy or franchise, it's crucial to ensure that each movie can stand on its own. Unfortunately, this film fails to achieve that, presenting a boring three-act structure where nothing significant happens.\r\n\r\nThe film's suspense is nonexistent, failing to create any sense of tension or atmosphere. A suspenseful movie should keep viewers on the edge of their seats, but this one falls flat. \r\n\r\nThe characters are mostly unlikable, making it hard to invest in their fates. In a horror film, it's essential to have characters that the audience can either root for or fear for. Here, the protagonists' lack of depth and development leaves viewers indifferent. For example, there's a scene where the main character faces a crucial decision, but due to poor character development, the moment lacks emotional weight and impact.\r\n\r\nI recall an experience at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights Terror Tram ride in Hollywood, where we were led through the mountains all the way to the Bates Motel. During this trek, I encountered a Haunter dressed as the 'Sackhead Man' from the original movie. This character exuded an eerie presence that was genuinely unsettling. In contrast, the 'Sackhead Man' or \"Scarecrow\" as credited in this film, doesn’t even make the top three performances of 'Sackhead' that I have encountered. This portrayal lacks the menace and charisma needed to make a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nOverall, this reimagining fails to capture the essence of the original. It lacks suspense, atmosphere, and compelling characters, resulting in a tedious and forgettable experience. For a film to succeed in revitalizing a classic, it must honor the original's strengths while introducing fresh and engaging elements. Sadly, this movie does neither, leaving fans yearning for the original's superior storytelling and tension.",

                "review": "I love this movie. It is a brilliant dissection of \"testosterone movies\" in their most basic form. Typically, these films rely on a formulaic group dynamic to add depth to the stoic hero, as seen in the original. When the hero began to show emotion, another stoic figure was introduced to maintain the balance. In this reimagining, the tables have turned.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding cast of characters are formulaic stereotypes, including the dastardly villains. This approach cleverly mirrors the original's tactic but with a twist. For example, the antagonists follow the same pattern: once the main antagonist, Brandt, reveals any emotion, it is perceived as weakness, prompting the introduction of a more intense and hyper-masculine antagonist, Knox. This shift highlights the film's commentary on the traditional portrayal of strength and vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, Dalton, adds unexpected layers to the story. Unlike the typical stoic hero, Dalton displays mental health struggles and other vulnerabilities, making him a more complex and relatable character. He is constantly conflicted and fighting his inner demons, much like Knox, but he strives to control his wild and reckless tendencies. For example, Dalton's struggle with his darker impulses is poignantly depicted in scenes where he battles both external foes and his internal conflicts, showcasing his depth and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis modern-day Western with a twist offers a fresh perspective on the concepts of heroes and villains. By the end, the film delivers a new message that challenges traditional notions of heroism and villainy. The nuanced portrayal of Dalton's character and his journey towards self-acceptance and control provides a thought-provoking narrative. For instance, the climax where Dalton must confront his own nature and make a crucial decision encapsulates the film's theme of inner strength and redemption.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie stands out for its innovative take on a familiar genre. It successfully deconstructs the typical testosterone-fueled narrative by focusing on the protagonist's vulnerabilities and internal struggles. This fresh approach not only adds depth to the characters but also redefines the genre's conventions. I would love to see more stories told in this manner, offering new perspectives and challenging traditional narratives.",

It doesn't reach the heights of the original, nor does it plummet to the lows of the less successful installments. I would rank this film slightly below Ghostbusters II. While it’s fun, it suffers from a messy story and too many characters.\r\n\r\nThe film's main issue lies in its sprawling narrative. With too many characters vying for attention, the story becomes a bit disjointed. For example, the original Ghostbusters worked so well because it focused on a tight-knit group of protagonists, allowing for rich character development and clear, coherent plot progression. In contrast, this film tries to juggle multiple subplots and character arcs, leading to a lack of focus.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie has its enjoyable moments, the story feels scattered. Key plot points are often rushed or underdeveloped, leaving the audience wanting more depth and cohesion. For instance, a subplot involving a new character’s backstory is introduced but never fully explored, making their motivations and actions feel superficial. This scattered approach detracts from the overall narrative impact.\r\n\r\nDespite these flaws, the film does have its charms. It’s a fun addition to the franchise and includes plenty of moments that fans will appreciate. The humor, special effects, and ghost-hunting sequences are all entertaining and Paul Rudd shines throughout.\r\n\r\nHowever, it lacks the nostalgic appeal of Ghostbusters II. The second film, despite its own flaws, managed to capture the magic and charm of the original. This new installment doesn’t quite evoke the same feelings. It feels more like a modern reboot than a continuation of the beloved series. For example, the nods to the original films are present but often feel more like fan service than integral parts of the story.\r\n\r\nWhile this latest Ghostbusters film is not without its faults, it is still a fun watch. It doesn’t quite capture the nostalgia or coherence of the earlier films, but it adds a new layer to the franchise that fans might enjoy catching on TV. It’s worth a watch for its entertainment value, even if it doesn’t fully live up to the legacy of its predecessors.",

                "review": "2024 has been a challenging year for studio movies, with only a few standout gems amidst a sea of disappointments. Trigger Warning, starring Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall, exemplifies the year's below-average offerings. This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, marred by a convoluted and disjointed narrative.\r\n\r\nThe plot of Trigger Warning is a mess, filled with bizarre and inexplicable decisions made by the characters. Jessica Alba plays a special forces commando who, inexplicably, slams her boots with each step while trying to sneak up on assailants. This odd choice undermines her character's supposed stealth and expertise.\r\n\r\nThe film’s action sequences are riddled with inconsistencies. Alba's character can effortlessly take down three armed robbers twice her size in one scene, yet is easily subdued by untrained opponents in another. These contradictions make it difficult to suspend disbelief and engage with the action. \r\n\r\nAnthony Michael Hall’s portrayal of the villain is equally problematic. His character is a caricature of a mustache-twirling right-wing politician, lacking any depth or nuance. Additionally, the film suffers from an overabundance of villains—four or five, with no clear connections to one another. This multitude of antagonists dilutes the narrative and makes it difficult to follow the central conflict. \r\n\r\nThe movie tries to mimic subplots from other action films but fails to integrate them coherently. Each subplot feels disjointed and out of place, contributing to a chaotic and unfocused storyline. For example, an attempt to incorporate a redemption arc for Alba’s character is abruptly abandoned, leaving her motivations unclear and unconvincing. Every character is dull and makes poor decisions, culminating in a ludicrous climax where all the disparate plot threads collide nonsensically.\r\n\r\nOverall, Trigger Warning is a prime example of the lackluster studio films that have characterized 2024. The film’s convoluted plot, inconsistent action scenes, and poorly developed characters make it a tedious and frustrating watch. Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall’s talents are wasted in this misfire, which ultimately fails to deliver any coherent or engaging entertainment. This is one movie that is best avoided, as it offers little beyond confusion and disappointment.",

These films don't typically resonate with me, but I watched this one for review purposes and found myself really enjoying it. While the plot is simple, it is not without charm, and the acting meets the expectations for this genre, complete with its share of cheesy moments. However, it tells a pleasant story with some worthwhile themes.\r\n\r\nThe plot may be straightforward, but it is executed well, providing a satisfying narrative arc. The story centers on a woman trying something new and unexpectedly finding love, a familiar trope that is handled with care and sincerity. \r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway is the standout performer in this film. She has a remarkable ability to elevate even the most formulaic scripts, bringing nuance and depth to her character. Her performance is both heartfelt and engaging, making her character's journey compelling to watch. \r\n\r\nWhile the film includes many of the genre's typical elements, such as predictable plot points and moments of cheesy dialogue, it manages to use these conventions to its advantage. The familiar beats of the romantic drama are present but are handled with a light touch that makes them enjoyable rather than tiresome. \r\n\r\nThis film is a pleasant surprise. It might not break new ground in the romantic drama genre, but it offers a heartwarming story with strong performances. It's an enjoyable movie to watch with your significant other, providing a comforting mix of romance, humor, and genuine emotion. If you're looking for a feel-good film that touches on themes of love and self-discovery, this one is definitely worth a watch.",

The film offers a delightful mix of thrills and humor, making for an enjoyable viewing experience.\r\n\r\nThe standout performances in the film elevate its overall impact. Dan Stevens brings a charismatic presence to his role, delivering both action and comedic moments with ease. Melissa Barrera also shines, adding depth to her character with a nuanced performance. However, it is Alisha Weir as the young vampire Abigail who truly steals the show. Her portrayal is both endearing and fierce, capturing the complexities of a young vampire navigating a chaotic world.\r\n\r\nIt is always a pleasure to see Giancarlo Esposito on screen, and his role in Abigail is no exception. He brings a gravitas to the film that balances the lighter, more chaotic elements. I would have preferred more of his character in the film.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is a mixed bag of chaotic characters that fit well within the tone of this horror comedy. While some characters are more memorable than others, they collectively contribute to the film’s energetic and unpredictable atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe comedy in Abigail is well-timed and effectively breaks up the tension of the action scenes. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, allowing for playful moments that enhance its entertainment value. The twists, while not entirely unexpected, are executed with enough flair to keep the audience invested. For example, a late-film revelation about Abigail's origins adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, adding depth to her character and setting up potential future installments.",

                "review": "Kevin Costner channels his inner John Ford with his immense passion project, starting with Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1. Unfortunately, in this initial chapter, he falls short of making a lasting impression akin to Ford's timeless works. Costner serves as the film's producer, director, co-writer, and star, undertaking a monumental task. This film marks the first chapter of a four-part epic series that weaves together the lives of various characters around the territory of 'Horizon'. The saga will span 12 years, with this first film serving to introduce Horizon and its primary characters.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble cast is led by Costner himself, alongside Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Luke Wilson, and many more. While the cast is impressive on paper, the execution leaves much to be desired. The characters feel underdeveloped, and the acting often comes across as lackluster. Sienna Miller and Sam Worthington, despite their talents, struggle to breathe life into their roles, making their characters feel one-dimensional.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, Costner's direction and the film's cinematography are commendable. The sweeping landscapes and meticulously crafted shots capture the grandeur and harsh beauty of the American frontier. His wide-angle shots of the sprawling territory and close-ups that highlight the characters' rugged determination are visually stunning, reminiscent of classic Westerns. These elements create an immersive atmosphere that is one of the film's few strengths.\r\n\r\nThe primary issue with Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 is its role as a setup for future installments. The film feels more like an extended prologue than a standalone story. The plot is fragmented, with numerous threads introduced but few developed to a satisfying degree. \r\n\r\nWhile the film has its flaws, it lays the groundwork for what could become a compelling saga. The potential for intricate storytelling and character development exists, but it is not fully realized in this first chapter. If the subsequent films can build on this foundation and address the gaps in the plot, Horizon could evolve into an epic worth watching. However, if the pacing and character development issues persist, maintaining interest in the series may prove challenging.\r\n\r\nGiven its ambitious scope and narrative structure, Horizon: An American Saga might have been better served as a TV miniseries. This format would allow for more detailed character arcs and a more deliberate pacing, giving the story the room it needs to unfold organically. The episodic nature of television could provide the depth and continuity that the film format struggles to achieve in this case.\r\n\r\nOverall, Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 is a visually impressive but narratively weak start to Kevin Costner’s ambitious project. While the direction and cinematography stand out, the lackluster acting and fragmented plot diminish its impact. The film serves primarily as a setup for future chapters, which may hold promise if they can build upon and enrich the story introduced here. As it stands, Horizon has potential, but it will need to deliver more in its subsequent installments to truly captivate its audience.",

                "review": "The Bikeriders presents an interesting Shakespearean kind of tale, depicting the story of 'The Vandals' Motorcycle Club. The narrative captures the essence of motorcycle club culture, showcasing moments that resonate as authentic and familiar. Each scene featuring the club members is compelling, particularly those with Tom Hardy's Johnny and Austin Butler's Benny, whose performances are truly fantastic.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy and Austin Butler deliver standout performances that elevate the film. Hardy brings a raw intensity to Johnny, capturing the character's complexity and inner turmoil. For instance, scenes where Johnny grapples with leadership decisions reveal Hardy's ability to convey vulnerability beneath a tough exterior. Butler, on the other hand, exudes charisma as Benny, making his character's journey both engaging and poignant. His chemistry with Hardy is palpable, adding depth to their on-screen relationship.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jodie Comer's character, Kathy, poses some challenges. While Comer’s acting is solid, the direction and certain choices surrounding her character are problematic. Kathy’s accent is particularly distracting, detracting from the immersion of her scenes. This is less noticeable during her interactions with the club members but becomes glaringly obvious in scenes where she talks to the photographer documenting the club. These segments, intended to provide narrative bridges or twists, feel awkwardly inserted and disrupt the flow of the story.\r\n\r\nThe decision to have Kathy narrate the story while speaking to the reporter, who is based on the real-life author of the book the film is adapted from, feels misplaced. It might have been more effective to narrate from the reporter's perspective or tell the story in a straightforward manner. For example, a linear narrative would have maintained continuity and made the time jumps less jarring. The disjointed structure often breaks the momentum, making it difficult to stay fully engaged with the plot.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, the core story of The Bikeriders remains compelling. The film captures the camaraderie, conflict, and emotional highs and lows of life within a motorcycle club. The writing, though disjointed due to the non-linear timeline, still conveys the drama and intensity of the characters' lives. A more linear approach could have enhanced the storytelling, providing a clearer and more cohesive narrative arc.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Bikeriders is a film with a lot of potential, highlighted by outstanding performances from Tom Hardy and Austin Butler. Their portrayal of Johnny and Benny injects the film with energy and emotional depth. However, the film is hampered by narrative choices and distracting elements, such as Kathy’s accent and the fragmented timeline. While these issues don't entirely diminish the story's impact, they do detract from the overall experience. The film is worth watching for its strong character portrayals and the authentic depiction of motorcycle club culture, but it could have been more powerful with a more straightforward narrative approach.",

I distinctly remember the drab cramped spaces and the washing fluttering like multi coloured flags, hanging from grimy windows. Until then, I had no idea people could and did, live like this.\r\n\r\nTwilight of the Warrior: Walled In takes its cue from the graphic novel to re-create the environment inside the walled city. A city which was, in essence, a self governing city, withing Hong Kong city. Unsurprisingly, criminal gangs vie for supremacy in the walled city. This story focuses on internal conflict within the controlling gang, triggered by the arrival of a newcomer with a past shared by the gangs leader. A situation taken advantage of by an external gang, who want control of the city, for their own benefit. \r\n\r\nThis tale capably mixes fantasy, martial arts and social commentary. It's a detailed story, that you need to pay attention to or it can become a little hard to follow. Not helped by the fact its probably in Cantonese (Hong Kong's primary language), not English. That said, its a decent back story that's worth your time, highlighting the hardships but also the comradeship, of the walled city's residents.\r\n\r\nAction sequences which dominate the film, mix martial arts and parkour within the confined city spaces, in a way that's frenetically entertaining, if, at times, a little unbelievable. \r\n\r\nThere is a profusion of respected, Hong Kong acting talent on display. too, which adds real depth and polish to this production.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Twilight of the Warriors deep dives into a period of Hong Kong history that's been forgotten, in a way that's nostalgic, at times raw in its social commentary and extravagant in its martial arts set pieces. Perhaps the only downside, the complex story, that can be difficult for non-Chinese speakers to follow.",

Its a decent cast, who have found themselves mis-cast, no doubt, I'm guessing, so the script can play gender politics. Suffice to say, the quality acting, is one of the limited upsides, of this flick.\r\n\r\nIn summary, no amount of suspension of disbelief, will make this work.I personally wonder why they persist, when everything I see, seems to suggest the viewing public have thoroughly rejected, the DEI agenda, in favour of  a return to traditional, sensible, entertainment.",

Sharks soon turn up leading to the presence of a  female shark, the scientific group have been monitoring.Inexplicably the shark has essentially doubled in size, leading their all knowing female boss to ask the divers to take \"a sample\" from the monster for study, rather than following the sane and reasonable path of fleeing in terror. Predictably, the shark doesn't take this treatment too well and eats the divers. At this point our intrepid female lead having just witnessed the horrific attacks on her research ships monitors, dives into the water, to confront the monster with a spear gun, that would hardly scare a large Tuna. \r\n\r\nWithout spoiling things for those who want to watch this, it doesn't get any better from here on in. Really if you are going to make a film of this kind, is it truly that hard to make it, at least, a little believable? \r\n\r\nThe acting is alright, as are the action sequences but the sense of \"terror\" found in Jaws is largely absent. The key ingredient that drives, what is essentially a monster movie, forward. \r\n\r\nIn summary, sinks beneath its own unbelievable story and  bland exposition.

It does make vain attempts to utilises tropes and events of the earlier films but fails to develop a measurably meaningful, original narrative, to accompany them. Moreover, as other reviewers have stated, quite correctly, in my view, its safe ending does little to mitigate the overriding sense of cinematic malaise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you have never experienced the Omen franchise, don't start with this film.

Our hero, a slim young girl, apparently has the wherewithal to take on and defeat, a savage interplanetary killer. A killer, as we can recall from the first film, who chewed through all but one member, of a hardcore team, of special forces mercenaries.\r\n\r\nSure, Arnie's character did use old style tactics, in the end, to defeat the beast.

I frequently found myself holding my breath, tensing, jumping and having to take breaks to get over my own sense of fear, at what I was witnessing. \r\n\r\nI was heavily invested in the main characters, wanting to see them safely escape their horrible predicament, in spite of their reckless decision to climb an obviously rusted, dilapidated tower. \r\n\r\nIn short, great edge of your seat stuff. Just goes to show how much can be achieved with a modest budget and a lot of inspiration.",

City Hunter comes across as somewhat eccentric, in what I'm guessing, is a very Japanese way. There's is a decent amount of, at times, over the top but nonetheless, engaging action,topped off with a rather textbook but still entertaining, sci fi twist. \r\n\r\nPerhaps a minor negative or at least an eyebrow raiser for Western audiences, are some rather odd ball antics, that might seem a bit unapproachable. That said, perhaps this comes with the territory?\r\n\r\nIn summary, nothing special but certainly fast paced and action packed enough, to merit a look.",

It appears to be mostly about people from diverse backgrounds being either abused by \"the system\" or co-opted into it, as state sponsored abusers. \r\n\r\nThe results feels like what it is. A moral statement viewed from a particular point of view, rather than an exciting, sci fi film, which is what, in this reviewers opinion, it should have been. \r\n\r\nIts slow paced, not terribly exciting and really goes nowhere interesting but then, how could it? \r\n\r\nIn summary, I, for one, am sick and tired of having simple escapist entertainment hi-jacked to peddle a specific world view. That is what activism and social commentary are for. Of course, the irony too, is the harder this kind of thing is foisted on people, in my experience, the more they tend to reject it.",

                "review": "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",

                "review": "The latest in the long-running and popular Transformer series has arrived with “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”.  Taking a cue from the recent “Bumblebee” movie,  the movie cleverly serves not only as a prequel but as a platform to introduce a series of stories leading up to the original films.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a planet-destroying evil is fixated on obtaining a key that will allow it to travel to any point in the universe to continue its reign of destruction. The animal-based Maximals are able to escape with the key and hide it on Earth where they will also remain in secret as guardians.\r\n\r\nFlash forward to 1994 when Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), following his stint in the Army is looking to find gainful employment to help his mother as well as his ailing brother.  Despite being a wizard with electronics Noah is not considered to be a team player which has hampered his job prospects and leads him to consider criminal activities in an effort to obtain much-needed funds for his brother's medical bills.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of desperation, Noah attempts to steal a loaded Porsche but finds he is unable to follow through on the act as it is against his moral compass.  Unknown to Noah the car is actually an Autobot named Mirage (Pete Davidson), who soon enlists Noah to help them find the key which they have recently detected.\r\n\r\nThis does not sit well with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), who believes that humanity will only act in your best interests and that his crew needs to find the key so that they can return to their war-ravaged, Cybertron.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a crafty but perpetually overlooked museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback), has accidentally activated the key and in doing so has allowed the evil Scourge (Peter Dinklage), and his minions to zero in on its location as he attempts to obtain the key for his master and is willing to destroy all were in his way.\r\n\r\nNoah and Elena soon find themselves paired with their unexpected allies as they race to stop the evil from obtaining both parts of the key and find themselves with some unexpected allies in the form of the Maximals.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a frantic action-adventure film that cleverly combines humor, action, dazzling visual effects, and a tail that is part Indiana Jones, and Transformers with a surprising amount of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for the human cast the overshadowed by the massive and visually spectacular creations that frequently transform and battle it out across numerous action sequences.  However, director Steven Caple Jr. takes advantage of his young talent both of whom are clearly potential stars in the making as they provide a grounding humanity to the film which makes it more than a lavish FX showcase.\r\n\r\nThe film also has an impressive era-specific soundtrack and a scene near the end that offers up some intriguing and exciting possibilities for the future. \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" is a highly enjoyable summer action adventure as well as one the more enjoyable films in the franchise and should delight fans of the franchise and has me for the first time in a long time eagerly awaiting what comes next.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in “Spider-Man: No Way Home”.\r\n\r\nTaking place where “Spider-Man: Far From Home” ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

                "review": "The Mercenary with a mouth is back with the eagerly awaited arrival of “Deadpool 2”. The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).  When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.\nHis first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.\n\nOne would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.\nUndaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.\n\nWhat follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.\nMy biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.\n\nThis time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.\nThey also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion.  What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to “fix” various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.\n\nI cannot wait to see what comes next as “DeadPool 2” is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.\n\n4 stars out of 5",

                "review": "The epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

In the new Pixar film \"Elemental\" audiences are introduced to Ember (Leah Lewis), a young flame being who lives with her mother and father in their combination home and business that caters to other fire beings. In a city where the various elements live and work can have its challenges, especially to the destructive nature of fire which causes some prejudice against them as well as their natural distrust of water.\r\n\r\nEmber is preparing for the day that she will take over the family business however her inability to deal with customers leads to combustible outrage which in turn results in a flooding incident at their business. Further compounding matters is the fact that a city inspector named Wade (Mamoudou Athie), who is a water element has been sucked into the basement and promptly documents multiple violations that shut down the business.\r\n\r\nDesperate to undo the damage, Ember strikes a deal that she will work with Wade to locate and fix the source of the leak in a few days time which will result in the removal of the infractions against the family home and business.\r\n\r\nAlong the Way, Wade and Ember start to grow close however the incompatibility of their two elements presents an obstacle as does the various elements of their respective societies.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a charming and visually appealing adventure that tugs at the heartstrings the way that the best Pixar films can.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple thematic elements at play and they're presented in a very matter-of-fact way that doesn't become overly preachy and can appeal to viewers of all age levels. Aside from the obstacles facing a mixed relationship, there are elements of finding your way in the world while trying to appease your parents, dealing with those who place limitations upon you, and finding your voice.\r\n\r\nThe characters are charming and engaging on the visuals of the world comprised of elements is often quite charming and clever. It will be very interesting to see what the future holds for the characters as there are certainly opportunities to revisit them in the future which would be very welcome as \"Elemental\" is a very charming and engaging return to form for Pixar and the perfect summer film for the entire family.",

                "movie_countries": "United States",
                "review": "“The Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever\r\n\r\nIn 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.\r\n\r\nWhile four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\r\n\r\nIn “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\r\n\r\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\r\n\r\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\r\n\r\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\r\n\r\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\r\n\r\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\r\n\r\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\r\n\r\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\r\n\r\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\r\n\r\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

The family lives in a magical home that is the center point for the community and is loved by the community.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney film “Encanto”; audiences are told the story of how the family patriarch founded the community with a magical candle and how upon reaching a certain age; all members of her family receive a “gift” from the magical house which gives them an ability to help the community. From being able to heal with cooking to talking to the animals and super strength; the family Madrigal is the beloved pillar of the community.\r\n\r\nTo every rule there is an exception and young Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz); is the only member of her family not to receive a gift of powers. As such she is seen as a pariah from the family and believes she is more tolerated than loved especially compared to her siblings who are endowed with amazing abilities.\r\n\r\nThings change when a new member of the family goes through the gifting ceremony; the first one since Mirabel was denied, and receives an amazing gift and basks in the love of the town and family. Mirabel has a vision of the house cracking and falling into ruin. She tries to warn her family but they see the house in its usual pristine condition and blame Mirabel for being jealous for not having a gift and wanting to take attention away from those who do.\r\n\r\nMirabel believes in what she saw and learns that members of her family may know more than they admit and that they hold the key to saving the day. This leads to a quest to find the absent Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo); who has been absent as many believe his gift of prophecy only leads to bad things coming to fruition and has gone into hiding as a result.\r\n\r\nMirabel is soon forced to look deep inside herself and find her strength to overcome her own insecurities and save her family and community.\r\n\r\nThe film has great animation and is awash in color as it brings the magical community to life. The music is lively and is what you would expect from Lin- Manuel Miranda as it brings joy and energy to the film that is in keeping with the Disney tradition of amazing music in their animated films.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue that I had with the film is that while fun and entertaining; the story never took the next step forward and at times dragged. This is not to say that “Encanto” is a bad film as it is lively, colorful, and fun; however it does not reach the heights of Disney classics like “Frozen” “Moana” and other classics. Think of it this way; “Lilo & Stitch” is a fine animated film but few would hold it in the same regard as “The Lion King”, “Beauty and the Beast”, and “The Little Mermaid”.\r\n\r\nIn the end “Encanto” offers a fun experience for the family and fans to enjoy and shows how even when they do not hit the top of the mountain; Disney is still the Gold Standard in animation.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

                "review": "When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the new film “Venom: Let There Be Carnage”; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus’s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as “Carnage”.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any “wow” moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",

                "review": "The long anticipated “Justice League” has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion.  \r\n\r\nThe death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet after he collects the three needed artifacts that his plan requires.\r\n\r\nIn a race against time, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to battle to save the planet. Naturally they battle amongst themselves as well as their massing enemies but ultimately decide on a dangerous plan that can tip the odds in their favor and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe action in the film is good but it often plays out like a video game. With so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds, the movie looked like a video game. There were numerous scenes that looked like they were lifted from Injustice and Injustice 2 that I mused to myself that someone must have used their Power Up for the shot.\r\n\r\nAffleck and Gadot are good and work well with one another, but there are some serious casting issues with the film. The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television. His comic relief status grew old fast and his character really offered little to the film.\r\n\r\nIt has been well-documented that Joss Whedon not only handled the rewrites for the film but took over directing duties to complete the film. You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.\r\n\r\nIn the end “Justice League” is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road.  As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",

                "review": "The digital animation geniuses at Pixar are back with “Turning Red” and it marks a departure for the studio known for the “Toy Story” and “Cars”, franchises.\r\n\r\nSet in 1990s Toronto, the film centers around 8th grader Mei (Rosalie Chiang), who considers herself an adult at 13 and eagerly applies herself to school when she is not helping her family tour business at a local Temple or hanging with her friends.\r\n\r\nLife comes crashing to a halt when after a traumatic day of embarrassment; Mei awakens in the form of a large Red Panda. In a panic, Mei attempts to hide her situation which causes her over-protective mother to assume it is Puberty related and that her hormones are kicking in.\r\n\r\nMei desperately wants to get her life back to normal and learns that as long as she is calm her Panda is under control. However, this proves to be harder than expected and soon Mei learns that the Panda is the result of a family bloodline but there is a way to end it during a Lunar ceremony in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nChaos soon follows as Mei struggles with her situation and must find a way to cope with the changes that are going on and make some very important decisions about her life and her future.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review for me as never having been a teenage girl dealing with puberty, raging estrogen, and the issues that go with it.  That being said the film struggles to find a balance as it tacks on the capers of Mei in Panda form without being overly funny or charming and keeps the focus on Teen Angst, puberty-related issues and becoming an adult.\r\n\r\nThe film lacks the interesting characters, charm, and appeal that have set the foundation for so many Pixar films and it is surprising that a company that can elicit a range of emotions in an animated short fail to really connect with their latest feature. There were some amusing parts but the film as a whole was rather dull and lacked much in the way of humor and was very predictable.\r\n\r\nThe decision to put the film directly on Disney+ as the studio’s recent “Soul” and “Luca” was raised some controversy but in the end, I do believe it was the right decision as “Turning Red” is not likely to be a film that draws people to the cinema beyond the opening weekend.\r\n\r\nIt is a film that is a bold step for the company, but one that lacks the charm and humor of previous films as not everyone is going to want to sit through a feature-length film on teenage angst and dealing with changing bodies and the emotional turmoil that follows.  However, the target audience is likely to connect with the characters and it will be interesting to see what the reaction to the film is long-term.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5\r\n\r\n“Turning Red” will debut on Disney+ on March 11th",

                "review": "The latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has arrived with “Shang Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings”.\r\n\r\nThe film introduces audiences to Shang Chi (Simu Liu); an easygoing San Francisco resident who spends his time parking cars and hanging out with his friend Katy (Awkwafina) and her family.\r\n\r\nLife is steady if unspectacular until he is accosted on a city bus by a group looking to take a pendant his mother gave him. When Shang Chi shocks Katy and the occupants of the bus with his martial arts abilities; he attempts to find his sister Xialing (Meng’er Zhang); who runs an underground fight club. While Xialing is estranged from her brother; their father Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) has conspired to bring them and their pendants before him.\r\n\r\nTheir father uses the power of sacred devices known as the Ten Rings to rule for over a thousand years and destroys all who would oppose him thanks to their power and the army he has gathered over the centuries.\r\n\r\nWenwu wants to revive their long-dead mother as he is convinced that she is calling to him and he wants to be with her as he was able to be a better man and forsake the power and abilities the rings offered him.\r\n\r\nWhen it is learned that Wenwu plans to go to a mythical realm that their mother came from and free her or burn the place to the ground; Shang Chi must make some hard choices between family and doing what he believes is right.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an action-filled thriller with plenty of mysticism and humor.  The film has a very engaging visual style that combines Asian and Western cinematic styles which results in some very engaging visuals as well as action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets the film apart from many Super Hero films is that the characters have a solid base to them as they have a complexity to them in regards to their past and their motivations. Their relationships with one another are key to the film as family, honor, and justice are key elements to the film but they are not given lip service but are developed well along with their characters.\r\nWhile the final act may be a bit FX heavy for some; I found it in keeping with the story and the characters and the great Sir Ben Kingsley provides some very welcome comic relief in his return as Trevor.\r\n\r\nAwkwafina is also great as she provides some very laugh-out-loud moments but is not afraid to mix it up when the situation calls for him. Simu Liu was very enjoyable in the lead role as he performed the physical aspects of his character well but added a restrained sensitivity to his character as he is a complicated individual who is conflicted by choices he made in his youth and the ramifications of them now as an adult.\r\n\r\nThere are bonus scenes that set up future adventures well including one that will no doubt have Marvel fans heatedly debating when the film premieres.\r\n\r\nOnce again Marvel has shown why they have had such a sustained success with their films as they have done a great job again of introducing a new character to the Cinematic Universe but also connecting him to their cinematic past and future.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

                "review": "“Sing 2” is a charming and enjoyable follow-up to the 2016 “Sing” and in many ways is the rare sequel that surpasses the original. The new film finds Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) and his performers enjoying a run of sod-out shows in his theater.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to settle for success in a regional locale; Buster and crew set off for the big city to produce and perform a show for Bigshot Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale); who is as ruthless as they come. After conning his way into an audition; Buster claims their new show will feature the return of reclusive Rock Icon Clay Calloway (Bono); who has been a recluse for the past fifteen years.\r\n\r\nJimmy is intrigued and gives Buster a chance and inserts his daughter Porsha (Halsey) into the show despite the fact that while she is a gifted singer; her acting is cringe-worthy.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a madcap tale filled with music and humor as the crew desperately tries to get the show ready and stay away from the very dangerous Jimmy Crystal.\r\n\r\nThe music is very good and the cast is as enjoyable as ever. I would have liked to have seen Seth Mac Farlane return but the performances from Taron Egerton, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, and the ensemble more than deliver.\r\n\r\nFor those who enjoyed the first film and are looking for some fun entertainment for the family; “Sing 2” is a winning performance.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

                "review": "The God of Thunder returns in Marvel Studios’ “Thor: Love and Thunder” and audiences find that Thor (Chris Hemsworth), has been doing missions with the Guardians of the Galaxy while he works himself back into shape and looks to find a new purpose in life.\r\n\r\nThor has been taking the spotlight in many of the missions and when multiple calls for help arise, Thor opts to go off on his own to address a particular call for help while the Guardians head on their way to help others.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a being named Gorr (Christian Bale) has been killing Gods and Thor is eager to put a stop to him before he can do more damage. His mission soon puts him on a collision course with Gorr and The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman) who being his ex and wielding his former weapon causes more than a few funny and awkward moments.\r\n\r\nIn a race to save captured children, rally the gods, and defeat Gorr, Thor, and Jane along with Korr (Taika Waititi) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), embark on an epic adventure in a race against time.\r\n\r\nWhile audiences have come to expect Marvel films to be epic cinematic events, this film is less on the over-the-top action sequences in favor of establishing new circumstances and challenges for the characters going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile there are indeed action sequences and plenty of VFX, it does not have the action or intensity of several of the past films. What it does offer is a good mix of action and humor with enjoyable characters old and new and establishes scenarios for the MCU going forward.\r\n\r\nBale is very good as Gorr and you understand his motivations clearly as while evil, he has a degree of sympathy towards his character which makes his creepy performance all the more compelling.\r\n\r\nThe cast works very well with one another and there are two scenes in the credits which open up all kinds of possibilities for the future as we are told Thor will return before the credits even begin to roll.\r\n\r\nThe film also has considerable music and I joked to myself that Guns and Roses are going to be getting a big check due to their music being used frequently during the film as well as that of other artists which helps make the film an enjoyable outing from start to finish which should delight fans as we wait to see for the next cinematic offering from Marvel.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

                "review": "Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

                "review": "The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.\r\n\r\nFormer supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.\r\n\r\n“Despicable Me 4” is a lazy movie overall, which is a shame because the technical aspects are so excellent.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "Writer / director M. Night Shyamalan‘s most annoying filmmaking traits are on full display in his latest movie “Trap,” a psychological thriller that initially promises an engaging narrative but ultimately collapses into the void of ridiculous twists and turns. This is far from Shyamalan’s finest hour, and the film rambles and sputters into one of his most unbelievable and absurd revelations yet, one that is so inanely dumb that it’s impossible to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe story follows everyday dad Cooper (Josh Hartnett) attending an afternoon concert with his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue). Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) is the hottest ticket in town, and Cooper splurged on floor tickets to make his little girl happy. Things seem fine until they’re not, and it’s revealed that Cooper is actually a serial killer nicknamed Butcher. Turns out the cops have set up a complex police blockade at the show with the intent on capturing him, and it’s clear he has no way out. Forced to use his wits to evade and escape, Cooper comes up with a series of clever distractions in order to keep his deep, dark secret hidden away from the FBI agent and criminal profiler in charge (Hayley Mills).\r\n\r\nThe first half of the movie is compelling enough, with a tense atmosphere and a buildup that hints at a plot that could have some sophisticated intricacies. It’s fun to watch how Cooper’s mind works, and it’s uncomfortable once you realize you’re rooting for a serial murderer to escape. This is done reasonably well and is the best part of the movie. The second half, however, derails spectacularly. The story becomes increasingly convoluted and nonsensical, introducing a series of ludicrous twists that undermine any semblance of coherence. This is bad even for Shyamalan.\r\n\r\nHartnett does a great job with his performance and is tasked with playing two men in one. He’s believable as the calm and goofy dad, but also switches to a dark psychopath on a dime. He’s by far the best part of the movie. Of course, while Harnett’s performance is one of the most enjoyable aspects, one of the film’s most glaring flaws is the weak turn from Saleka Shyamalan. I don’t want to pick on her as she is the director’s own daughter, but the forced nepotism reeks here. Saleka can’t act, she’s a mediocre singer and songwriter (a half dozen of her original songs are prominently featured during a majority of the film’s run time), and the movie comes across as being made solely to showcase M. Night’s kid while trying to make her a star. Her performance is as unconvincing as Harnett’s is credible.\r\n\r\nWith a contrived and nonsensical plot, bad performances, and an illogical twist that will leave you more frustrated than entertained, “Trap” is another disappointing effort from a director who could do so much better.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.\r\n\r\nThere’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.\r\n\r\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\r\n\r\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\r\n\r\n“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "movie_countries": "France",
                "review": "Diving headfirst into the genre with all the enthusiasm fans could hope for, the horror / disaster film “Under Paris” is sometimes campy and often ridiculous, but also stands out as a solid entry in the niche of killer shark flicks. It may not be a great film by conventional standards, but this one is not going to disappoint with its willingness to take the premise everywhere fans of creature feature cinema will want it to go.\r\n\r\nSet in current day, the city of Paris is getting ready to host the World Triathlon Championships on the Seine. They’re expecting a large number of athletes to compete by swimming in the famous river, but there’s a big, big problem. Sophia (Bérénice Bejo), a brilliant marine scientist with a tragic past, learns from environmental activist Mika (Léa Léviant) that there is a large shark living deep in the river. In order to avoid a literal bloodbath, they join forces with the Seine river police commander Adil (Nassim Lyes) to stop the potential carnage.\r\n\r\nIt’s actually a pretty great premise, even if the science behind the narrative is (mostly) laughably implausible. While entertaining, the story gets bogged down under its over-the-top ecological messaging. The film is preachy about global warming and how humans are the real enemy, so much so that it can sometimes feel like it’s a project sponsored by Greenpeace. But there’s something admirable about director Xavier Gens‘ commitment to his message, and it adds a layer of sincerity to what is a creatively dumb premise.\r\n\r\nThe movie strikes a nice balance between classic horror and a disaster story, bridging the two in a satisfying way. It has its dumb B-movie moments (including corny, stating-the-obvious dialogue like “There are sharks in Paris!“), but Gens avoids the outright stupidity of franchises like “Sharknado.” It’s absurd, but also delivers plenty of suspense and thrills.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are a mixed bag, with effects that feel very low budget. There’s a goofy shark fin that sticks out of and races through the river, and murky underwater shots dilute much of the action. But there are also bloody, gruesome shark attacks that seem very realistic, and the makeup department has created horrific images straight out of a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIf you can stick with the slower parts of “Under Paris,” you’re going to be rewarded with a surprisingly great ending. Dumb yet creative, preachy yet thrilling, the movie takes its outlandish premise to all the places that fans of the genre will appreciate.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "“I mostly loved it, but I kinda hated it” has pretty much become my mantra with the filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos, a writer/director whom most moviegoers will either loathe or adore. There are those of us who are firm fence sitters with his tales of absurdism and cruelty (although I skew towards the yay! versus the nay!), and it’s honestly a toss-up whether or not you’ll enjoy his latest bizarro project, “Kinds of Kindness.”\r\n\r\nWritten as a triptych fable that weaves together three distinct narratives, the film has layers upon layers of hefty, rich themes that are as thought-provoking as they are (at least on the surface) head-scratching. The first is a story of a man who has no choice in his life path, but is finally trying to stand up and take control of the direction his existence has been heading. The second is a totally weird tale of a policeman whose wife has gone missing at sea, but he becomes convinced that a doppelganger of her has returned home, where he delights in torturing her mercilessly. The final story is about a spiritual cult member who is determined to find a mysterious woman with a special ability who can lead the group to their destiny. It’s better to go in knowing as little as possible about the narrative, because the memorable surprises and general “WTF?” moments are also the film’s most successful.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with most of his former projects, Lanthimos once again gravitates towards the surreal, with unsettling stories that explore themes like fate, identity, free will, authority, power dynamics, and the complexities of human connection. It’s macabre and funny; dramatic and disturbing. The contemporary stories interconnect with a subtlety that’s incredibly well done through shared themes and recurring motifs, and the film blurs the line between dreamlike fantasy and harsh reality.\r\n\r\nFurther connecting the three stories together and keeping with coherent themes, Lanthimos keeps his cast small, utilizing the same actors (including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Mamoudou Athie, Margaret Qualley, and Hong Chau) in different roles in each of the fables. Very few directors working today can consistently draw out exceptional performances from their actors, but Lanthimos is one of the true greats. Everyone is top-of-their-game terrific, with a jaw-dropping, standout turn from the limitlessly versatile (and immensely talented) Plemons.\r\n\r\nObviously, “Kinds of Kindness” isn’t a film that will appeal to everyone. With its existential musings, experimental narratives, abstract storytelling, and deliberate pacing, Lanthimos certainly does not cater to mainstream tastes. But the small segment of movie lovers at which this visionary project is aimed will be up to the challenge (and of course, absolutely delighted).\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” revisits the popular franchise with the expected heavy dose of nostalgia, and thankfully Eddie Murphy‘s enduring charm overpowers the uninspired screenwriting and lackluster storyline. Filled with callbacks, familiar faces, and the iconic soundtrack that defined the 80s, this comfortable journey back to the streets of Beverly hills with the Detroit detective feels tailor-made for fans of the series.\r\n\r\nIrreverent detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is back on the beat in the 90210 after his attorney daughter Jane’s (Taylour Paige) life is threatened. A lot of very powerful people want her to back off a case involving some very dirty cops, and she reluctantly works with her estranged dad to get to the bottom of all the threats. Axel teams up with a new local “partner” (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old pals Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) for help uncovering what turns out to be a big conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIt’s a formulaic and predictable plot that still serves as a solid framework for a classic crime story. Murphy effortlessly slips back into Foley’s shoes, delivering the wisecracks with that million dollar charisma that made the character a fan favorite (and himself a certified movie star). It’s fun to see Reinhold and Ashton in action again, but they are mostly there to serve up some additional ‘memberberries. Cast additions Paige and Gordon-Levitt inject some fresh energy into the mix, which, despite their characters both feeling underdeveloped, is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThe film takes the nostalgia to the next level, including the overuse of the franchise’s best-selling soundtracks. There are three classic tunes in the opening ten minutes, which feels like a gimmick to get viewers settled into a certain mindset. It works, because this trip through familiar territory is one that relies heavily on the ability of its audience to “just go with it.” Director Mark Molloy delivers what fans expect, from serviceable action sequences, lighthearted humor, and a safe formula that is far from groundbreaking (because it doesn’t need to be).\r\n\r\n“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” is a good enough nostalgia-filled reunion with Murphy’s iconic character. It’s ultimately forgettable, but still provides an enjoyable ride for those looking to revisit old friends and relive the magic of the original films.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "There’s a lot to appreciate about “MaXXXine,” writer/director Ti West‘s latest film in his horror trilogy, even if he doesn’t quite stick the landing. The whole project feels like, as one of his characters says in one of the film’s most memorable lines, a “B-movie with A+ ideas.” There’s plenty of blood and gore to appease slasher fanatics, but there’s a depth to the film that comes from the hefty themes about sex, opportunity, religion, and Hollywood’s dark underbelly.\r\n\r\nSet in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, adult film star and aspiring big studio actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) finally gets her big break into the mainstream. She’s been cast in a supporting role in a horror movie sequel and is set to work with up-and-coming director Elizabeth Bender (Elizabeth Debicki). Things are looking up for Maxine career-wise, but a mysterious stalker who is targeting the starlets of Hollywood seems to have her directly in his sights. When a trail of blood makes it clear that several murders are directly connected to her, Maxine starts to worry that her sinister past is going to be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the film is also the best, and West fully embraces the decadence and danger that goes along with the backdrop of sleazy Hollywood. Filmed with a vintage aesthetic and Eighties feel, the neon-lit, blood soaked movie looks like it has stepped out of an exploitation cinema time capsule. It’s an homage that’s done exceedingly well, from the cinematography to the soundtrack to the costume design.\r\n\r\nThe casting is perfect across the board, with standout performances from both Kevin Bacon as a menacing bad guy and Giancarlo Esposito as Maxine’s attorney agent, Teddy Night. (Even the supporting roles are meaty, featuring solid turns from Michelle Monaghan, Moses Sumney, Bobby Cannavale, and Sophie Thatcher). Goth is once again terrific as a shrewd woman with a fierce ambition, lending the ideal mix of street smart toughness with a relatable vulnerability. West never demeans his lead character either, which is refreshing. The film portrays sex work and the adult film industry as a legitimate profession and Maxine as a strong, empowered woman who takes charge of her own destiny.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film derails with a conclusion that seems both corny and disappointing (at least on the surface). The ending is left open for rampant speculation, which is probably going to polarize audiences. I think it’s fun when a film can be interpreted in several different ways, but this may prove frustrating for moviegoers who like things very black and white.\r\n\r\nBest of all, “MaXXXine” leaves plenty of room for a fourth film featuring the character, which I certainly hope we get.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "“Fly Me to the Moon” is so generic and sanitized that it feels like a blanket, sterilized television sitcom designed to appeal to the masses in middle America. Director Greg Berlanti‘s throwback romance has its moments, but even the chemistry between the leads a few flashes of creativity can’t save the overlong, draggy film.\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of NASA’s historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, former con artist Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) is hired by President Nixon’s clandestine staff member Moe (Woody Harrelson) to launch a marketing campaign on a mission that the White House has deemed too important to fail. Kelly has a huge job cut out for her, and her fiery personality, unconventional methods, and out-of-the-box ideas to fix the space agency’s public image wreaks havoc on the straight-laced launch director, Cole Davis (Channing Tatum). She’s in his way and is a major annoyance, but even Cole can’t deny the sparks that are flying whenever the two are in the same room.\r\n\r\nThe film works as a mid-level romantic comedy with Johansson and Tatum sharing an agreeable chemistry that, while not exactly electric, at least feels organic. Their playful banter and genuine affection shines, providing some of the film’s most enjoyable moments. It’s a classic odd couple pairing that adds much-needed comedic elements.\r\n\r\nThe script is messy and forgettable, with a lot of ineffective bids at humor. The most charming aspects are burdened by unnecessary subplots that detract from the main story, making the entire film feel far too long. Certain scenes drag on and on, especially when relying on clichés, predictable plot points, and tired tropes that fail to fully capitalize on the unique setting and wealth of historical context. So much more could’ve been done with this material in a much better way.\r\n\r\nAlthough it provides some decent lighthearted entertainment, “Fly Me to the Moon” plays it so safe that it definitely falls short of its potential. It’s overstuffed and bland to a fault, struggling so mightily to be a crowd pleaser that it squanders most of the charm and authenticity that could have made it something truly special.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "Director Doug Liman’s “Road House” is a wild ride of fightin’, spittin’, cussin’, and bone snappin’, a testosterone-fueled muscle movie that’s perfect for a weekend stream. Taking a more dramatic angle with a drug and crime story, this re-imagining of the 80s cult classic still delivers plenty of action and entertainment, even if it lacks in originality and substance.\r\n\r\nTrouble is brewing at a Florida Keys roadhouse, and proprieter Frankie (Jessica Williams) is desperate for some old fashioned law and order. The local police won’t help, so Frankie seeks out ex-UFC fighter Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) for the job. Down on his luck, he agrees to take the well paying gig in paradise. When he arrives, Dalton discovers that he’s stepped into a criminal underworld that’s darker and more serious than anticipated. One by one, he outsmarts and out muscles the seemingly endless line of bad guys that stand in his way.\r\n\r\nThe film works well because of its willingness to embrace its own over-the-top absurdity. Gyllenhaal plays Dalton with an authentic, rugged charm, taking his character seriously, but not overly so. He’s believable as a tough guy for hire who “hurts people for money,” and he lends a pedigree to an otherwise mindless piece of entertainment.\r\n\r\nConor McGregor is a lot of fun in his supporting role as Knox a worthy adversary to Dalton. Insane and unhinged, he feels like a ripoff of the Jason Momoa character Dante in “Fast X,” minus a bit of charm and acting talent.\r\n\r\nThe movie is over-the-top in a lot of ways, but the one thing that really bugged me is that early on, there’s a casual mention of a killer crocodile. This caused my mind to wander the whole movie, just waiting on the edge of my seat for Dalton to wrassle it (spoiler alert: I was so disappointed).\r\n\r\nThat’s not to say the movie isn’t corny, because it is. Those little touches of humor, the charismatic lead, brawny action sequences, and nods to classic muscle movies also make it wildly entertaining.\r\n\r\nLet me put it this way: “Road House” ends with a clear set-up for a sequel that I wouldn’t necessarily be excited to see, but I’d definitely be first in line to buy a ticket.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "movie_countries": "United States",
                "review": "Richard Linklater‘s “Hit Man” is a film with a serious identity crisis. This genre blending disaster starts out as a wannabe goofy comedy, then veers off the rails into dark noir, finally settling on a bizarrely erotic femme-fatale rom-com. This movie is absolutely terrible, and its only saving grace is its lead’s bonafide Hollywood star power.\r\n\r\nStraight-laced professor Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) has an odd hobby: he moonlights with the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man. With a penchant for inhabiting different personalities and donning outrageous costumes, Gary has a knack for telling potential clients (and marks) just the right things to get them arrested. Things get complicated when he falls for Madison (Adria Arjona), a potential criminal who meets with Gary to discuss hiring him to murder her awful husband. The two start a romantic relationship in a sea of deception and moral ambiguity, which changes Gary’s life forever.\r\n\r\nIt’s a great premise for a film, but Linklater just can’t make it work. While he admittedly isn’t one of my favorite directors, he completely misses the mark here. The narrative is disjointed and the tonal inconsistencies are too jarring, and no amount of talent can balance the uneven, overstuffed elements of comedy, romance, and thriller. The film struggles on just about every level, but thankfully Powell saves it from being completely unwatchable.\r\n\r\nPowell is the highlight here. His charm and versatility shines as he navigates the complex layers of his character. This is an actor who is a true chameleon, and the film at least provides a vehicle where he can showcase his range. Powell is great; the movie is not.\r\n\r\nLinklater introduces a lot of bland melodrama with the relationship between Gary and Madison and, despite a believable chemistry, it causes the film to stumble even more. With her character’s motivations being murky at best, it was impossible to feel fully invested in Madison’s relationship with Gary’s alter-ego, Ron.\r\n\r\nFor a film that had the potential to be so unique, it ends up feeling generic and unsatisfying. Despite having a small theatrical release, “Hit Man” is a disappointing effort that appropriately feels right at home as a streaming title on Netflix.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "Slasher fans are going to admire writer / director Chris Nash’s fresh and original, yet still traditional, take on the horror sub-genre with his sadistic film “In A Violent Nature.” With his distinct style and extremely unsettling movie, Nash subscribes to the Terrence Malik school of thought with a “less is more” approach, delivering a visually impactful and terrifying film that’s filled with violence, gore, and a brooding atmosphere that makes it feel wholly unique.\r\n\r\nJohnny (Ry Barrett) is a vengeful spirit who is resurrected and ready to deliver payback after a horrific crime that occurred over 60 years ago. Johnny’s been brought back to life when a group of friends remove his treasured locket from his final resting place, a collapsed fire tower that lies deep in the woods. What follows is a methodical slaughter of the group that disturbed his locket, and it is clear that Johnny isn’t going to stop until every single one of them is dead.\r\n\r\nNash’s stylistic choices are so effective here, as he uses long shots of the back of the killer’s head to create a sense of dread without showing his face. He’s hulking and frightening, and being forced to imagine his appearance goes so far in conveying a stone-cold nature that leads to feral and brutal massacres.\r\n\r\nViewers are immersed and walking right alongside the murderer instead of the victims, creating a more penetrating, intimate, and less detached experience, a perspective that’s rarely explored in horror films. It’s disturbing, especially when you consider the killer’s lack of motivation. I was constantly asking “but why?,” and the randomness of his killing spree is what makes it so scary. Simply put, if you’re there, you’re dead.\r\n\r\nThe movie demands concentration and patience, but rewards viewers with a chilling, atmospheric experience. Heavily reliant on narrative-driven dialogue and visual imagery, the film is suspenseful and clever. Nash lets his camera observe with a detached yet intimate lens, savoring each bloody kill without being overly gratuitous. It’s the type of approach that will earn the respect of genre fans, delighting both horror lovers as well as artsy, hardcore slasher aficionados.\r\n\r\nThat’s not to say that there’s not a fair share of violence. The film features some truly gory and creative kills that are made even more horrific with Nash forcing audiences to watch the grisly brutality unfold. With zero humor to break the tension, this in-your-face experience is something that dedicated horror enthusiasts and those who savor the most macabre elements of the genre are going to love. The suspense is palpable, especially as the camera lingers on the kills in a way that makes them both artistic and heinous.\r\n\r\n“In A Violent Nature” is classic slasher flick with a twist. It’s suspenseful, clever, and innovative in its storytelling.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Co-directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears and co-written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg, this animated feature is confident, action packed, funny, and is a visual delight. It’s a crowning achievement in animation, and the perfect summer movie to boot.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of four turtle brothers, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), who were mutated after a dangerous laboratory explosion left them covered in radioactive ooze. Their adopted father Splinter (Jackie Chan), a kind and elderly New York City sewer rat, has sheltered his teenage sons from the harsh, dangerous, and judgmental human world for over a decade. Deciding that they want to be accepted as normal teenagers, the brothers head out into the city on their own, crossing paths with young reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri). A fast friendship develops, and the turtles find themselves taking on a mysterious crime syndicate that’s run by fellow mutants.\r\n\r\nIt’s a good story that’s elevated by across-the-board talent. Spears and Rowe’s crackerjack direction is on point, especially when it comes to orchestrating thrilling action scenes. This is easily one of the most well-directed animated features I’ve ever seen. Energetic and bursting with enthusiasm, it’s nearly impossible not to have a blast watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe characters are great, too. The turtles may be mutants, but they still act like regular, dumb teenage boys, finding humor in the silliness of everyday experiences. The voice performances are outstanding too, with a talented cast and a diversity that feels natural and appropriate. Everyone (including Paul Rudd, Ice Cube, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and Giancarlo Esposito) gives top-tier turns, and it makes the movie even better.\r\n\r\nIt’s worth noting that this animated film isn’t made for little kids, and youngsters will likely be very bored and fidgety. This is more of a movie that’s geared towards ‘tweens, teens, and their parents (especially dads over 35 who grew up with the Ninja Turtles in various iterations). I would think longtime fans would be enamored with what the film does to their classic heroes, because a person like me who had very limited knowledge of the characters was quickly won over.\r\n\r\nFilms like “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” are exciting because not only are they breathing exciting life into the animation genre, they are setting the highest standards for quality, edgy animated films for adults. We should all hope for more projects of this caliber.",

There is nothing about “Sonic the Hedgehog” that seems like it will be watchable, much less actually good, but I’ve been proven wrong by this lively, wacky, and campy family film. There’s oodles of fun to be had here by both adults and kids.\r\n\r\nThis live action adventure comedy is based on the blockbuster SEGA game that centers around a speedy bright blue hedgehog named Sonic. Basing a movie on a flimsy gaming character will be ill-advised at least 95% of the time, but this movie finds the ideal balance between a lively (if basic) original story and well-placed Easter eggs for fans. Here, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) has a series of misadventures on Earth with his newfound human friend Tom (James Marsden), a small-town police officer. The two have to work together to stop the villainous Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) from capturing Sonic for his evil experiments.\r\n\r\nThe themes of friendship and loneliness are at play, and the cast does a great job keeping things fun. Marsden is ridiculously likable and goofy as an everyman, and Schwartz brings an empathy that carries the majority of the film with his voice performance. Best of all is Carrey, hamming it up with a manic stamina that’ll remind you why you always loved him in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of action scenes and rude humor (and a couple of strange, over-the-top scenes that read as advertisements for Olive Garden), which are all entertaining enough to recommend “Sonic” for a fun family night out at the movies.",

Combining a lesbian love story with a brawny thriller, this gritty, bloody, and brash film was one of my favorites to come out of this year’s Sundance Film Festival.\r\n\r\nLou (Kristen Stewart), a reclusive gym worker who spends her days mopping floors, unclogging toilets, and laminating membership cards, is barely surviving her small-town existence. Her world transforms in an instant when the transient bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O’Brian) crosses her path. Lou falls hard for those rock hard muscles, and she invites Jackie to move in with her. Ambitious to a fault, Jackie begins training for a competition in Las Vegas (and starts injecting steroids at the encouragement of Lou). The plan is for the two to take an epic road trip out West, but a startling act of violence involving Lou’s sister (Jena Malone) and brother-in-law (Dave Franco) changes everything. The truth about Lou’s criminal family is revealed, further complicating not only her romance with Jackie, but pulling both women into a web of absolute mayhem.\r\n\r\nGlass has created a film with a deliciously pulpy, crime thriller vibe. Her bold and distinctive style is reflected with a voice that practically screams with an underlying rage and intensity (and one of the best uses of magical realism I’ve ever seen in a movie). Lou and Jackie are flawed people, but you just can’t help rooting for their relationship. They are capable and guilty of some very, very bad things, but goddamn if these two aren’t meant for each other with their explosive love story for the ages.\r\n\r\nStewart and O’Brian deliver stunning performances, embodying their characters with a ferocious spirit that reflects the lust and desire of their tumultuous relationship. Their chemistry is palpable and intense, which lends an additional layer of authenticity to the story. The supporting cast is nothing short of terrific too, with effective turns from Anna Baryshnikov, Ed Harris, Franco, and Malone.\r\n\r\nPassionate and provocative, “Love Lies Bleeding” is the type of film that gets under your skin. Beneath the violence and revenge, it’s a queer love story that’s hopelessly and breathlessly romantic.  \r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "movie_countries": "United States",
                "review": "When they get the notion to remake an animated classic into a live action film, Disney is a well-oiled machine. They’ve found varying degrees of success and failure (“The Lion King,” “Cinderella,” “Pinocchio”) along the way, and their latest cartoon-to-real-life adventure “The Little Mermaid” lands somewhere on the better-than-average scale. There are things that work (a scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch), things that don’t (a painfully lengthy run time), and things I never want to see again (the truly dreadful “Under the Sea” number), but the film’s reimagined storytelling delivers just enough magic to weather the storm overall.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the classic story of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a curious and spirited young mermaid who yearns for adventure on land. Ariel is the youngest of King Triton’s (Javier Bardem) daughters, and also the most defiant. She spends her days exploring shipwrecks and avoiding dangerous sharks (and humans) with her crustacean pal Sebastian (voice of Daveed Diggs) and her loyal fish friend, Flounder (voice of Jacob Tremblay). On her quest to find out more about the world beyond the sea, Ariel makes a deal with evil sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy) to cast a spell and give her human legs in exchange for her voice. She must find true love’s kiss from the dashing Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) within a few days or the consequences will be dire.\r\n\r\nThe film sticks to the original story, and the fairytale seems outdated. The idea of marrying a handsome prince in a few days is icky, even if it is a fantasy film. It’s interesting how much of the action feels a lot more dire in a live action setting versus in an animated film, with scary eels getting blown to bits and a shipwreck that’s set ablaze as sailors swim for their lives. The worst part of the cartoon to live action translation has to be Sebastian and Flounder, however. It’s startling to see Ariel’s buddies look like a realistic talking fish and crab, and it’s one of the most jarring and unpleasant things about the movie. It takes a lot of willpower to go with the flow, if you can get over the initial shock.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is dark and drab (although it does look as if it’s really filmed underwater), and Rob Marshall‘s direction is barely adequate. The film is choppy, slow, and long, and its biggest failure is the uneven pacing. Some of the better parts of the story are hurried along in favor of what should be show-stopping action, but the film is so dark that it’s hard to tell what’s going on in what should be the most exciting moments. Why rush the more compelling elements of the narrative in favor for a poorly executed final battle between Ursula and our heroine? It really strips away a lot of the undersea magic.\r\n\r\nThe cast helps keep things afloat, and the performances are all solid. McCarthy is the standout with her robust turn as one of Disney’s greatest screen villains, and Diggs breathes a fresh, new life into loyal crab Sebastian. Casting Awkwafina as the voice of know-it-all seagull Scuttle is inspired, and she creates an updated version of the character that’s the perfect fit for the film. Perhaps the greatest strength comes from the irresistible chemistry between Hauer-King and Bailey, two actors who comfortably step into their lead roles with plenty of charm. She makes a great Ariel, finding a terrific balance of innocence, curiosity, and stubbornness, and he is the perfect non-threatening Prince Charming that is the stuff of many young girls’ dreams.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing the film does right is keeping the original arrangements of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman’s most beloved songs (the updated verses, which removed some problematic and antiquated lyrics, are done well and hardly noticeable). Cherished ballads like “Part of Your World” and “Kiss the Girl” have a stirring emotional power that immediately helps audience form a strong connection with the material, even if the movie is just so/so. The soundtrack probably makes the movie seem a lot better than it actually is. The new tunes, including a kid-friendly number called “The Scuttlebutt” (featuring lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda), sound too contemporary to really fit in, but they’re fun and bring a bit of spirited pep when the film becomes draggy.\r\n\r\n“The Little Mermaid” isn’t a great movie, but it’s one of the better Disney live action remakes because it stays true to the source material. There’s just enough magic, adventure, and romance to make this a satisfying experience for the whole family.",

                "review": "“The Bikeriders” offers a gritty and atmospheric portrayal of a Midwestern motorcycle club’s transformation over a decade, capturing both the allure and peril of a subculture defined by rebellion and camaraderie.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Jeff Nichols, the film delves into themes of loyalty, brotherhood, and the evolution of identity amidst a changing America, and features terrific performances from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, and Tom Hardy. While not a true story, the movie is inspired by a 1963 photo essay and book by Danny Lyon, a photographer who spent time with the Chicago Outlaws riding club in an effort to document the life and times of the American biker. Nichols creates a fictional world inspired by a culture that was a very real part of the Sixties.\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of a tumultuous era in American history, the film introduces bad boy Benny (Butler), a newcomer to a local motorcycle club called the Vandals. Led by the enigmatic Johnny (Hardy), the club initially serves as a sanctuary for misfits and outsiders seeking a sense of belonging in a world that seems to have left them behind. In other words, Benny fits right in. Most of the narrative revolves around his complex relationship with the strong-willed Kathy (Comer) and the tug of war that ensures between Benny’s allegiance to the club and his feelings for his old lady.\r\n\r\nIt’s a story of love, loyalty, identity, and brotherhood that’s filled with power struggles and eventual violence, and Nichols captures the heart of his narrative as the club and its members undergo a transformation that spans roughly a decade. The evolution of the characters can sometimes feel a little too predictable, but Nichols captures the spirit of the time with a sometimes-subtle (and sometimes not) exploration of the motorcycle club subculture and its various intricacies and complications.\r\n\r\nOne of the more surprising things I liked about this film is how it romanticizes masculinity in a way that’s reminiscent of classic Hollywood. Benny is a Brando type, with a rugged individualism that’s more muted than overpowered with a showy bravado. These are rugged, tough men, who abide by an unspoken code of brotherhood. It not only makes the characters more appealing, but it also adds to the authenticity.\r\n\r\nNichols visually captures the essence of his film’s setting too, immersing viewers in a world where leather-clad riders navigate the open road despite the turbulent dynamics within their own ranks. The production design and cinematography are a perfect fit, both working in tandem to enhance the gritty realism of the biker world and the allure of rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnchored by solid performances and a nostalgic portrayal of American masculinity, “The Bikeriders” gives an effective and entertaining look at motorcycle culture.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "movie_title": "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant",
                "movie_countries": "United Kingdom, United States",
                "review": "Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren’t any montages, and the story isn’t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but “The Covenant” is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.\r\n\r\nSet during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley’s return to the United States. It’s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won’t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban’s most wanted hit list.\r\n\r\nIt’s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he’s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nRitchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line solider. The director’s visual storytelling is terrific here, as he switches between handheld shots with uneven movements to dizzying aerial shots to sweeping tracking shots seamlessly within one action scene. It creates a greater sense of immediacy and danger, expressing the gravity of the situation at hand.\r\n\r\nSome of the scenes are so distressing that I found my heart pounding throughout, and Ritchie’s use of harsh close-ups adds to the intensity. There’s a lot of cat-and-mouse content that adds to the tension, but it doesn’t feel gimmicky because this is a film that is unafraid to kill off characters at any time (so don’t get too attached to anyone).\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal and Salim make a dynamic onscreen duo, and both men have a natural chemistry that is the highlight of the film. Salim’s performance is dynamic and genuine, and Gyllenhaal proves yet again that he’s a formidable leading man. He’s in his natural habitat here, playing a rugged everyman with a non-threatening masculinity that gives him a broad, universal appeal. The performances from the supporting cast are also top-notch.\r\n\r\nThe story is one of integrity, loyalty, and respect, and these men have an incredible amount of honor. Ahmed and Kinley are forced to make tough decisions, but they never shy away from doing the right thing, even when it’s the harder option. These guys are still combat killers and trained soldiers, but their friendship takes center stage. This is such a great story of brotherhood that you’ll wish it was true (sorry folks, this is a work of fiction).\r\n\r\nThe film only makes a couple of missteps, and there are two major things that bothered me. First, the alpha male dialogue among the soldiers is openly homophobic. It’s laughed off and never challenged. I found this to be a bit problematic, but the way these guys talk is also likely accurate and authentic. Second, the grand finale shootout feels a bit like military propaganda, where the brawny American saviors must step in and become the heroes. It’s a sequence that’s thrilling, but feels stuffed in as a way to appease the hyper-patriotic “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” crowd.\r\n\r\nBut here’s where it gets interesting: the film is also highly critical of the U.S. government and the heads of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but those at a higher level do not. The film offers a scathing criticism that applies to the many ways the U.S. abandons its veterans too, from dismissing allegations of sexual assault, making it difficult to obtain proper healthcare, crafting vague promises, and flat-out lying. It’s a profound theme that may be lost on the majority of audiences (but I hope not).\r\n\r\n“The Covenant” is an extremely well made wartime action film, and those looking for a thrill will find it. Go and enjoy the entertainment value, but don’t lose sight of the small, emotional story that’s at the heart of it all.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / www.ScreenZealots.com**",

                "review": "Director Rich Peppiatt‘s rowdy, frenzied film “Kneecap” is a lively biopic based on the hell-raising Irish rap trio of the same name. You’ve probably never heard of these musicians, but the film celebrates the general sense of anarchy as these young men become key figures in a civil rights movement to save their mother tongue. It’s a story about finding your voice in a world that seems determined to keep you down, all told with a slew of swear words, hip-hop tracks, and lots of drug-fueled shenanigans.\r\n\r\nSet in West Belfast in 2019, the film depicts the origins of the group Kneecap, including insight on how they created their unique sound. In a bid to push back against the establishment, Liam Óg, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh (who play themselves in the film) take to the stage as a symbol of Ireland’s restless youth. They refer to themselves as “low life scum,” and their message resonates with so many. By writing and performing hip-hop songs in Irish, they become a local sensation. This garners the attention of their political martyr father (Michael Fassbender), the ire of party conservatives, and the adoration of the people.\r\n\r\nIt’s a true story that doesn’t give a ton of insight into the band members, but it’s still a lot of fun. The film features plenty of original music by the trio (which admittedly is an acquired taste), and their politically-charged rhymes and defense of their cultural heritage speak volumes. The guys write what they know, and the truth resonates with locals. It comes down to this: when cops don’t want people hearing your music, that’s when you know you’re doing something right.\r\n\r\nThe songs and the film rapidly switch between English and Irish, so it takes a lot of concentration to watch. I could see some viewers quickly giving up, but those who stick it out will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nLiam, JJ, and Naoise are rambunctious lot, and their shenanigans are sometimes questionable but always entertaining. There are quirky bursts of humor that make the boisterous characters even more appealing. None of these guys are great actors, but it adds to the unpolished authenticity of the film.\r\n\r\nThere’s a defiant energy to “Kneecap” that is invigorating, and the story is one that’s different and original.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don't think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It's pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either \"love\" or \"like\" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn't really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won't know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn't expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It's just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this review, and I'm getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can't really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson's, Evans', and Robert Downey Jr's (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't know what to do now. The only thing I'm sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn't fall asleep properly because I couldn't stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It's everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It's that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it's not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn't exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn't everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don’t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame … And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI don’t know how I should start, but I guess I’ll address something that people might ask: yes, it’s a SPOILER-FREE review. Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn’t make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character’s backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won’t take longer than one paragraph.\r\n\r\nPeople need to understand that these Disney’s remakes aren’t here to replace the originals. They’re here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the “additional” part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don’t know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from “I don’t want these copy-paste remakes” to “they changed that specific moment, why didn’t they keep it the same?” Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don’t want Disney to do these remakes, then just don’t watch them. Don’t go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven’t seen the movie. Moving on …\r\n\r\nI love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994’s original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It’s NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don’t understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people’s memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn’t watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.\r\n\r\nOne proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don’t know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar’s look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He’s more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there’s one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa’s. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones’ voice is. As soon as he says “Simba” in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let’s call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters’ relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed … You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original’s final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).\r\n\r\nJD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyoncé (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it’s another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It’s a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.\r\n\r\nI left the best to last: the visuals. I can’t possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward … a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can’t be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don’t emote is just inaccurate. You don’t need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I’m still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.\r\n\r\nI don’t really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There’s no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character’s decisions. We always know what’s coming, so we’re prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we’ve seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the “animals don’t emote” argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight … In the original, it isn’t nighttime as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, I just want to address the “these remakes aren’t necessary / no one asked for these” discussion. No one asked for the 1994’s movie until it came out. People didn’t know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren’t here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply “none”. That’s how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994’s film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn’t matter if we know what’s coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney’s best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones’ voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor’s Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original’s story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can’t lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019’s best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide… Go watch it! I can’t wait to see it again!\r\n\r\nRating: A",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of all-time. He has undeniable talent behind the camera, and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year they’re released. In addition to that, he’s also an extraordinary screenwriter, as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again. His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast, so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those “fairy tale” years. And that’s precisely what this movie is: a fairy tale in Hollywood, hence its title. Let me just leave this here right off the bat: I’m not going to address any controversy surrounding this film (namely, the whole Bruce Lee depiction and the Manson Family, in general), as I’m always fair and impartial to the movie I’m reviewing. Moving on …\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the 60s isn’t that good. Obviously, I know the whole Sharon Tate story, as well as the famous Manson murders, but when it comes to actual films from that decade, well … Probably, I only know a few by name, a classic scene, or a memorable soundtrack. Tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period, and that’s one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags. There’s a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music (references in the songs), wide shots of the city as they drive by (references in the buildings), or even just playing an LP and dancing to it (reference in the songs, again).\r\n\r\nI understand that these mean something, but if they don’t develop the character in any way, then these are just Easter Eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative. The first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much Tarantino knows about that time, and there’s nothing wrong with it, as long as it tells a story. That’s the second issue I have with the first act: it takes too long to establish its characters, and there’s no apparent objective within the story. It feels like a person just strolling around with no destination, which in itself isn’t a bad thing. But if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where it’s going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting (the Sharon Tate event), then you’ll bore the hell out of the audience (a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something, and they weren’t in a hurry).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from the moment we start understanding who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are, what they do, what they did, and what they want with their lives, then the film becomes incredibly captivating. It’s definitely a character-driven story. It’s a fairy tale where Rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star, after being on an exponentially negative path. Cliff, as his stunt double, lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else. These two are inseparable, and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy, even in the darkest moments. OUATIH works because of its beautifully-written characters.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t care about them, then you won’t enjoy the film at all. In addition to this, if you don’t know anything regarding the art of filmmaking, then you’ll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull. It’s one of those movies that anyone can like. However, for someone who knows and understands how films are made, it will always be a better time at the theater. You can love this movie, sure. But if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques, you’ll love it even more. There are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that I can’t get to all of them, so I’ll just address two of my favorites. The first has to be the black-and-white flicks inside the actual film. Putting Leonardo DiCaprio acting on classic westerns with over-the-top performances is an absolute delight. Watching those features in a 4:3 black-and-white screen, filled with classic sound effects, and cheesy one-liners … Wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie: the extensive one-take dialogues. I mean, 10 or 15-minute sequences where DiCaprio just gives it his all. This is how every single film should be done. There’s even a joke in the movie where Rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together. Unfortunately, that’s how most features are done today. Therefore, from watching a simple dialogue scene with DiCaprio and Julia Butters (a 10-year-old little girl!) to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie Rick is filming (this one even has Rick asking his lines, and the camera has to go back to its starting point), everything with no cuts whatsoever … What can I ask more from a director?!\r\n\r\nObviously, if this is a character-driven narrative, the cast has to be genuinely compelling. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie … I mean, do I even need to explain how phenomenal they are? DiCaprio proves once again he’s one of the greatest actors of all-time. The ability that he has to put 200% in every single scene is unbelievable. I even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing, solely due to the actor’s performance. The Oscar nom is guaranteed, let’s see about the win. Brad Pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display. He has a subtle performance, but it’s pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting (apparently) so little effort. Margot Robbie doesn’t have that much screentime, but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress’ life could be at that time, so she didn’t exactly need to deliver her A-game.\r\n\r\nIt’s always good to see Al Pacino (Marvin Schwarz) on-screen, and I’m thrilled that Margaret Qualley (Pussycat), who I know from The Leftovers (one of the most underrated TV shows of the century), is finally getting some recognition. Technically, like I said above, it’s close to a masterpiece. It’s Tarantino, everyone knows what he’s capable of, but having in mind his most recent features, it’s a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action. There are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography (Robert Richardson), and the editing is always impeccable in Tarantino’s features (this time due to Fred Raskin). The score is addictive, and it carries a very significant role in the movie. I would say that if Tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better, this would be a technically perfect film.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn’t the best Quentin Tarantino’s movie, but it’s undoubtedly one of the year’s best. Filled with award-winning lead performances (second Oscar for DiCaprio, please), this character-driven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not. Its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story, but from the moment it’s able to find its footing, it’s an entertaining ride. If you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art, Tarantino delivers a near-perfect technical production. Its alternate ending to real-life events is meant to be controversial, but for me, it’s a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or, indeed, a fairy tale … in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

Technically, no faults. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, with each shot meticulously detailed and rich in storytelling. The animation is a true work of art, drawing viewers into a world of wonder and magic. The sound design and score complement the visuals beautifully, enhancing the overall viewing experience. And finally, the film retains the typical Ghibli humor that fans have come to love, sprinkling lighthearted moments throughout the narrative.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hayao Miyazaki succumbs to his ambition. The filmmaker tries to incorporate too many ideas, resulting in a somewhat confusing, messy narrative, particularly in the transitions between different characters, locations, and story arcs. THE BOY AND THE HERON stumbles in its attempt to juggle multiple ideas, but overall, it still manages to deliver a delightful, enchanting experience for fans of the studio's work.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

                "movie_countries": "Canada, United States",
                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nObviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same \"version\" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show … He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). \"The world is getting crazier out there\", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just… there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater \"happy\" or \"joyful\", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

                "movie_countries": "United States",
                "review": "If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog was one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2020, not because I expected it to be one of the best films of the year, but due to the controversy that surrounded it. The original design of Sonic was awful, and a lot of people still blame the VFX artists/animators unfairly. These people work extra hours, they're underpaid, and they were given an impossible schedule to deliver a masterful work. Fortunately, most people now recognize that the studio and all of its execs are the ones to blame.\r\n\r\nThe Internet voiced its opinion in a very polite manner (as usual), but this time, an unprecedented event occurred: the studio actually listened and decided to delay the movie until Sonic received a better treatment visually. Now, I firmly believe that, in any other case, this would be extremely dangerous. I don't think the audience should have this much power over the studios, especially through social media. I mean, if studios changed their films every time people criticized a design or an adaptation decision, movies would be constantly delayed. However…\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, I'm super glad they did it. One question a lot of people might ask is, \"how would this film perform with the old design?\". It would be horrible. There's absolutely no chance of people enjoying this movie with the previous Sonic. This new design not only honors the character's visuals, but it complements the film's tone. Jim Carrey delivers an incredibly cartoonish performance, which would become way too out-of-place if Sonic looked (awfully) real. Having both the hero and villain being/acting like a cartoon, that awkwardness doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nSonic truly is the best part of the whole thing. If you've played the games and if you carry an emotional connection to this character, there are tons of scenes for you to enjoy. Sonic looks wonderful, sounds fantastic (excellent voice work from Ben Schwartz), and best of all, his personality resembles the videogame character. Everything that's directly Sonic-related is perfectly faithful to the source material, which will definitely please every Sonic fan. That's pretty much my main message: if you're a fan of the little blue guy, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he's honestly the only great aspect of the movie. It's really cool to watch Jim Carrey going back to his roots and having so much fun with his role. However, he's very hit-and-miss. When he's condescending someone, he's quite funny, but Carrey's mannerisms don't always work. Still, once again, I believe he's very faithful to the original Dr. Robotnik, who was by no means a \"normal\" person. James Marsden is really good as Tom, but his character never goes beyond \"Sonic's pal\".\r\n\r\nMy main issues are regarding the screenplay. No, I never expected it to be an Oscar-worthy narrative. I just wanted a simple story that allowed Sonic to shine, and in the film's defense, it's indeed a basic plot. However, the sheer abundance of cliches, the lack of any surprises, and the logical questions raised by some narrative decisions are too much to handle, in my opinion. There are three product placement scenes that are some of the laziest, obvious, cringe-worthy examples since the Transformers' movies. It feels like the film stops to have a few commercials.\r\n\r\nSubplots that serve as tension-building during the movie fail to have a resolution by the end. Storylines that were once important are entirely forgotten and never addressed again. Every single character serves as comic-relief, everyone gets to be the \"clown\". I repeat: I never expected a brilliant screenplay. But is it too much to ask the writers to have as much dedication and creativity as the VFX artists who handled Sonic? The latter group worked like crazy to deliver a perfect design. Why can't the writers try harder to offer a more compelling, unique, and rational story?\r\n\r\nThe way Dr. Robotnik comes into play and the level of permission he has to do whatever he desires to is laughable. Everything human-related raises too many eyebrows and rolls too many eyes. I've commented about the film online, and some people addressed me by saying, \"you're overanalyzing /you're expecting too much from it\". I wholeheartedly understand these observations, I genuinely do. The thing is: I don't believe I'm overthinking, let alone expecting it to be a masterpiece. Why should people simply accept that a movie \"can't be better than what it is\"? Why can't people ask for the potential that a Sonic film has? Why should I be content that it's \"not bad\"?\r\n\r\nI'm completely honest: I wanted to like this movie way more than most people. The whole controversy concerning Sonic's design and the unfair blame that the VFX artists received, left me with an overwhelming desire to absolutely love this film, so I could support the massive work that these people went through. I love everything that's Sonic-related in the movie. His design, voice, and personality are spot-on, and I can't imagine a single fan of the little blue hedgehog being disappointed. However, even with a really good cast and a 90s' Jim Carrey, Sonic the Hedgehog is packed with extreme cliches and narrative decisions that roll too many eyes. Some of the most obvious and cringe-worthy product placement since Michael Bay's Transformers. Characters built from Hollywood's recycling box and side stories are thrown away with no resolution. It's a fun adventure that any family can enjoy on a Sunday afternoon, but I can't lie to myself: I wish it could have been more entertaining and less frustrating story-wise.\r\n\r\nRating: C+",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nZombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, \"what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?\", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan.\r\n\r\nI genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a \"zombies fan\" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then \"fan\" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk.\r\n\r\nWhen the only \"negative\" aspect that I can find is related to \"maybe not-that-logical\" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk's script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch.\r\n\r\nHowever, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.\r\n\r\nIt's really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma \"do I save the person I care about or everyone else?\" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.\r\n\r\nThis movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a \"wake-up call\" to our protagonist, as a \"what if\" version of Seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.\r\n\r\nA runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it's South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can't find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSix years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn’t forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it’s safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.\r\n\r\nWith extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That’s what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney’s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they’re young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).\r\n\r\nIt’s the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don’t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn’t bring anything new story-wise, but it’s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa’s magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.\r\n\r\nEvery character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna’s complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven’s camaraderie, I care about all of them… especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn’t really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it’s impossible not to love him. He’s such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.\r\n\r\nCounting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it’s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It’s an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That’s what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it’s the genre’s variation of “show, don’t tell.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney’s formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade’s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn’t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company’s standards.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI was never a big fan of the Bad Boys films. Firstly, I'm not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he's fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can't forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren't very high…\r\n\r\nMaybe that's why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn't watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.\r\n\r\nAdil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay's. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn't land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot… I hate it. In the end, it's the cast who saves the boring narrative.\r\n\r\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn't as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it's dumb fun, and it's plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it's pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.\r\n\r\nIt's simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It's a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole \"Bad Boys one last time\" tagline… I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: \"Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?\" Honestly… no.\r\n\r\nRating: C+",

                "movie_countries": "United States",
                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a spoiler-free review of Far From Home, but NOT of Avengers: Endgame! So, if you still didn’t watch the latter or heard what happens in it (by some inexplicable reason), this is a SPOILER WARNING for the events of that era-ending film. Moving on to the web-slinger, this sequel is everything it should be and a bit more. It beautifully encapsulates how everyone’s feeling about the central death of Endgame, especially Peter Parker. I wished Jon Watts would put a lot of focus into Spider-Man’s grief and I hoped that a big part of the plot would be him just having to deal with the fact that his mentor/father figure is gone. He can’t continue to just be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He needs to grow up and become what everyone expects of him: to be the best of them all.\r\n\r\nWatts does all of it. There are so many emotionally powerful dialogues featuring Nick Fury or Happy (Jon Favreau) or even just moments with Tom Holland just standing alone and having to breathe through the pain of losing someone you love. The pressure that everyone is putting on his shoulders is immense, maybe too much for a simple teenager, but he’s everything but simple. I love every single bit of story dedicated to Peter and Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr.) relationship. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wrote a wonderful screenplay, and Jon Watts executed it seamlessly. However, the reason why all of this works is due to Tom Holland’s performance.\r\n\r\nHe said in an interview he would play Spider-Man until he can and until producers let him. I hope he stays around for years without end. He’s not only my favorite on-screen Spider-Man but my favorite on-screen Peter Parker as well. I love how he spends most of the movie holding on to his feelings, and in the last act, he just lashes out because he can’t take it anymore. He left my eyes close to tearing up in probably the best dialogue of the film with Happy. As a superhero, he perfectly embodies what Spidey is all about, and Holland has the plus of doing most of his action stunts. As a teenager, he’s incredibly funny, innocent, and he still doesn’t know how to deal with falling in love or having a crush, which leads me to the second of the three main storylines of this movie: his relationship with MJ. \r\n\r\nZendaya did get some criticism from fans who, well, don’t like the fact that MJ is not the same one as in Sam Raimi’s original trilogy (physically and psychologically). Same for Holland and the fact that this Spider-Man has a lot more “gadgets” than Tobey Maguire’s. For those people, I only have one advice: understand that this is a distinct universe with different takes on characters we know and with other stories to tell which are, in fact, the closest we had to the comics so far. The sooner you accept this, the easier will be for you to enjoy these films. Having that in mind, MJ didn’t have much to do in Homecoming. Actually, she was even played as a post-credits twist so that the sequel could focus more on her … and it did.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship gradually evolves throughout the movie smoothly and realistically. They’re teenagers! Having their first crush, trying to come up with a good time and place to tell the other they like them, being nervous when they’re together and being anxious when they’re separated … Watts handled this subplot very well. It didn’t feel forced (rom-coms should take some tips), Zendaya and Holland’s chemistry is palpable, and I love this new MJ. Most of the superhero’s lovers are the cliche damsel in distress, always needing saving and making dumb decisions. Zendaya’s MJ not only can handle herself, but she has an unique personality that makes her stand out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third and last storyline relies on Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). I can’t really get in-depth about this character because he has a massive impact on the narrative, but I can guarantee that Gyllenhaal makes this character work. I like how they approached Mysterio, but if it wasn’t for the outstanding actor that Gyllenhaal is, Far From Home would have suffered a bit. The relationship between him and Spider-Man is well-developed, but the character of Mysterio lacked better treatment. There’s an exposition dump midway through the runtime that’s just horrible. Really, really bad. However, the film moves on and gets better until it reaches the last 45 minutes, which are unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI will always prefer a slow start and a fantastic finish than the other way around. Far From Home struggles with the first two acts’ pacing, but the last one compensates that with some of the best action a Spider-Man movie ever had! There are so many sequences where our superheroes are just going at it, flying and swinging across buildings, bridges, and rivers like we’ve seen before, only better. The CGI looked like it could be excessive in the trailers, but instead, it’s some of the best Marvel has shown us. Nevertheless, the jaw-dropping scenes are some that involve illusions, very much like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) had in his origin flick. Spider-Man has two memorable sequences (the VFX here are mind-blowing), one of which incorporates a certain superpower not seen in the MCU so far (officially, at least). The kid in me was smiling with pure joy, let’s write that.\r\n\r\nIt’s on par with Homecoming. One is better than the other in various areas, but they’re extremely different, so comparing them might be unfair. The first had the goal of introducing a “new” character to the MCU, so the focus relied solely on Peter Parker having to deal with his powers and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This sequel is set so far away from the origin story and so much happened between these two that if people chose to watch them back-to-back, they wouldn’t understand much of what’s going on. Nevertheless, Far From Home still has its own issues.\r\n\r\nLike I wrote above, the first two acts struggle with its pacing. While it’s refreshing to watch Spider-Man in other cities besides New York, the transitions between them are ridiculously fast, especially one that takes Peter Parker to another country in such an illogical way. The film tries to play off these less rational moments with comedy bits quite often and sometimes it just doesn’t work, affecting both the tone and pacing. I liked Ned in Homecoming, and I also enjoyed his presence here, but this time he almost felt like just a comic relief guy instead of that essential “sidekick” to Spider-Man. Michael Giacchino’s score is good, but for some reason, I couldn’t really connect with it, which I think it’s the first time I don’t exactly love Giacchino’s themes. Finally, the comedy skits could be better, they don’t land that many times and the one supposedly funny scene I remember is the absolute worst.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I still had a blast! I think I prefer Far From Home to Homecoming since the latter deals with a much more complex and emotionally compelling story than the origin flick. The action is some of the MCU’s best and definitely as great as Spider-Man’s action ever was, featuring some mind-bending, astonishing sequences. The cast is brilliant, especially Tom Holland who cements his spot as the best on-screen web-slinger ever. Zendaya and Jon Favreau are also amazing, but I have to praise Jake Gyllenhaal’s performance because he’s just awesome every single time. It’s the movie the MCU needed after the tragic events of Endgame. It works because we feel what Peter Parker’s feeling and we can deal with our grief with the help of Spider-Man’s journey in this film. Aside from some minor problems with pacing, comedy, and exposition, the last act plus the two post-credits scenes, which have a tremendous impact on the movie and on what’s to come on Phase Four, are more than enough for you to go see this film at the theater. Don’t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.\r\n\r\nDespite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.\r\n\r\nNow, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative.

In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.\r\n\r\nFight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.\r\n\r\nI've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions… it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the \"seven deadly sins\", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.\r\n\r\nThe gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.\r\n\r\nI'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.\r\n\r\nTechnically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.\r\n\r\nMovies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.\r\n\r\nSe7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made…. I can't recommend it more.\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThis is it. The last David Fincher's film I'll be able to review before Mank, his next masterpiece… I hope. I've been through Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, and now it's time for Fincher's latest installment, Gone Girl. Clearly, Fincher loves to work with people he knows. Jeff Cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for Kirk Baxter as part of the editing team, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in the musical score. Even his production designer, Donald Graham Burt, has been around since Zodiac. However, Fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation.\r\n\r\nUsually, when it comes to writers, I take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn't exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it's completely different, I was being generous). With that said, Flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. From the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of Amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, Flynn's screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. With a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly Amy's and Nick's.\r\n\r\nThis story's greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. Nowadays, people don't even click to read the full article and understand its context. A single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. The same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it's on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. I may be wrong when I wrote the whole \"change of media\" matter before, but of this, I'm sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn't entirely revealed.\r\n\r\nThis takes me to Ben Affleck (Justice League, The Way Back) and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. In case you don't know, Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. Nick goes through the exact same obstacle. There's non-stop news about Amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can't find a single proof. Affleck doesn't even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. Definitely, one of my favorite actors working today.\r\n\r\nSince I'm in the realm of performances, I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike (Radioactive). Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Affleck's, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while Pike has a much more complex, layered role. She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. Honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for Pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range.\r\n\r\nCarrie Coon (Margo Dunne) is another actress I've grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she's terrific as Nick's sister. Her chemistry with Affleck is spot-on, and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Tyler Perry (Tanner Bolt) is also pretty great as Nick's lawyer, but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. Flynn's screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included.\r\n\r\nTwo minor issues. One of them, you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) out of the cast compliments above. Harris is fine as the character he portrays, but I can't help but feel that he wasn't the right actor for the role. This is a classic Fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. In fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene I've ever seen. Harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. Again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it's another evidence of David Fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nHere’s the thing about the Fast & Furious franchise: it can be dumb fun. Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic… As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can’t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn’t and take everything seriously. It’s not that you can’t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that’s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it’s not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they’re getting themselves into. However, it didn’t quite work for me this time…\r\n\r\nThe Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There’s no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It’s completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it’s unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that’s exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.\r\n\r\nSo, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn’t I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I’m in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn’t contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson’s chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don’t think it’s enough.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there’s no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the “superhero” vibe Elba should have. That’s the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your “heroes” are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your “superpowered villain” different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a “black Superman” has the same impact as a punch from the other two? \r\n\r\nThen, the comedy. It’s not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It’s just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn’t know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it’s going to end, but then there’s a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there’s an attempt at the start of a romance that I won’t spoil, but … It’s not like it’s forced because it actually isn’t. It follows a logical path, characters don’t say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There’s even a line similar to “I’ll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we’re still alive”, but they never go there again. It’s like it never happened… Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That’s disappointing.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I’m sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they’re definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won’t believe who’s in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn’t as bad as this review might transmit.\r\n\r\nI know I’m in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn’t really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast’s chemistry. \r\nPS: if you haven’t watched Game Of Thrones by now, heavy spoilers in this film. You’ve been warned.\r\n\r\nRating: C",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\n2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.\r\n\r\nAs with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.\r\n\r\nHowever, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.\r\n\r\nNow, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think \"oh, that's Mushu\". I think \"that's Eddie Murphy\". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

                "review": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAfter years of outstanding effort from passionate fans, Warner Bros. finally decided to give Zack Snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms. 2017's Justice League went through massive production issues - explained in my review of said film - and despite years of extremely tiresome, toxic discourse on social media, the famous Snyder Cut got a controversy-inducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut. A crucial disclaimer: you'll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I'm part of the latter group of reviewers.\r\n\r\nI find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it's appropriate, but it's a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what's coming from a general perspective. Still, I'm reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it's not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don't doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole \"it's a totally distinct movie\" or \"Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder's footage\" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn't need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017's version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder's Justice League better than its \"predecessor\".\r\n\r\nThe most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher's character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the \"Us United\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original's abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie's consistency.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it's more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL's score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.\r\n\r\nThere's only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don't belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It's by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn't heavily impact my opinion.\r\n\r\nA common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017's version, supposedly only Whedon's footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there's a couple of them that not only don't improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the \"bringing Superman back\" arc lacks an important character's take on the situation, having in mind that character's past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don't get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.\r\n\r\nRegarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it's really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can't get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.\r\n\r\nZack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL's all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

                "review": "Without revealing any spoilers, I want to share my thoughts on the sequel titled Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\r\n\r\nOriginally released in 1988, this sequel maintains the same humorous tone as its predecessor. It offers a blend of cheesy charm and new characters that bring fresh energy to the screen.\r\n\r\nThe nod to Charles Deetz in the film was both clever and funny, seamlessly incorporating the character despite the actor's passing. The filmmakers managed to pay tribute to the original while staying true to the comedic essence established by Tim Burton in 1988.\r\n\r\nMichael Keaton reprises his role as Beetlejuice with impeccable comic timing and character evolution. While he may have put on a few pounds, his performance remains as entertaining as ever. Winona Ryder shines in her lead role, transitioning from her role in \"Stranger Things\" seamlessly.\r\n\r\nJenna Ortega delivers a standout performance, embodying her character with skillful development. Surprisingly, Willem Dafoe's character, whom I initially had reservations about, turned out to be quite comical and well-executed. Bob's appearance in the film is endearing, and his character is sure to win hearts.\r\n\r\nFans will likely be clamoring for Beetlejuice baby toys after watching the film. One minor disappointment was a particular wedding scene that felt overly drawn out and reminiscent of the 1980s era. It could have benefited from some editing to avoid dragging on.\r\n\r\nI missed seeing Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis make even a brief cameo in the film, given their absence was noticeable. The digital recreation of the sandworm from 1988 was enjoyable, but the 2024 version lacked the same charm, coming off as cheesy rather than exciting.\r\n\r\nThe buildup surrounding Dolores, a new character, was intriguing but fell short in the climax, leaving me wishing for a more impactful resolution. Despite this, considering the 35-year gap between the original and the sequel, the film holds up decently.\r\n\r\nOverall, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice offered a fun and laughter-filled experience. I recommend watching it in theaters to appreciate its entertainment value. It's a worthy sequel that captures the essence of the original while introducing new elements. So, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!",

As such, I won't be comparing it to the earlier version.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the cameo appearance from an original cast member was a nice touch, though it didn't elicit the same level of excitement for me as it might for die-hard fans. Now, onto the movie itself.\r\n\r\n\"Mean Girls 2024\" is a hit-or-miss experience, depending on your perspective. Dedicated fans of the franchise will likely appreciate it for what it is. As someone who enjoys musicals and appreciates a variety of music genres, I found the film to be enjoyable.\r\n\r\nReneé Rapp's portrayal of Regina George showcases her stage background, but she eventually settles into the role as the movie progresses. Although her casting may initially seem odd due to her towering height, she brings energy to the character. Her catchy solo song stands out, showcasing her vocal talent.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics between characters, particularly Regina and Cady, felt a bit off to me, given their stark height difference. However, both actresses deliver strong vocal performances. The portrayal of Gretchen and Karen also adds to the mix of characters, each bringing their unique quirks to the screen.\r\n\r\nThe movie delves into LGBTQ+, transgender, and sexual themes, though without nudity, making it a film geared towards a younger audience. While these themes didn't bother me personally, they are prevalent throughout the movie.\r\n\r\nThough I wasn't a fan of the casting choice for Damien, finding him too eccentric, I appreciated the performances of the main characters. The male lead, though not heavily featured, serves his purpose in the storyline.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would consider watching \"Mean Girls 2024\" again, but perhaps not in theaters. I'm uncertain if I would allow my son to watch it due to the mature subject matter. Fans of the original \"Mean Girls\" or musical enthusiasts are likely to enjoy this adaptation. For those with a more casual interest in movies, it may be a good watch but not one that demands an immediate rewatch.",

I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe CGI in this film was subpar, making the characters seem out of place in a live-action setting. The walrus, the vulture, and Woody himself looked absolutely absurd. The voice acting and performances were also far too exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe plot was lackluster and failed to hold my interest. It was simply not enjoyable and more suited for younger children under the age of six. Older audiences are likely to be bored by this film.",

Surprisingly though, it manages to be one of those guilty pleasure movies that you can't help but enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhile it's not groundbreaking by any means, the movie is surprisingly captivating and entertaining. The story revolves around a lonely celebrity who finds love in an unexpected place, his own assistant's mother. Yes, it's a bit cliché with Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman's characters falling for each other, but there are enough twists and surprises to keep things interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are moments that are cringe-worthy, moments that are heartwarming, and moments that are just plain cheesy. But overall, the film manages to strike a balance that makes it worth watching. It may not be a masterpiece, and it's unlikely to become a favorite that you'll revisit often, but if you're looking for something to pass the time, \"Family Love\" is worth a watch. It's not as bad as some may think, especially if you're a fan of romantic movies.",

Oh my goodness.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to see Nathalie Emmanuel outside of the Furiously Fast series and it's nice seeing Omar Sy and Sam Worthington again but this movie just steadily gets more campy and more cringe and more stupid as it progresses. The best scene is probably the club hit early on, and it gives you a false sense that the movie is going to be better than the poster - it isn't. In that respect, The Killer (2024) reminds me of Smile (2022). Folks went crazy for Smile. Smile went downhill after the opening scene and never recovered.\r\n\r\nI watched Silent Night (2023). It wasn't horrible, but maybe John Woo should've stopped with that.\r\n\r\nI don't care that the story isn't original, I care that the script is poorly written and the direction is lackluster. Zee is poorly written, Sey is poorly written, Jenn is poorly written, and Finn says \"Kushala Daora\" one-two many times. Jax is probably the best written character and he's on-screen for like 5 minutes total.\r\n\r\nI got the impression early on that they were going for a Killing Eve (2018-2022) vibe, but yeah, no. It's just sad.\r\n\r\nCan someone competent take this cast, this concept - this \"Queen of the Dead\" idea, and do it properly?\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some female-led assassin action, check out  The Protégé (2021) which wasn't a masterpiece but it was more entertaining than this, Anna (2019), Salt (2010), Red Sparrow (2018), or Atomic Blonde (2017).",

Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking \"it's so nice, we'll say it twice\".\r\n\r\nThe story is predictable, made worse by the spoon feeding. To add insult to injury, the back and forth between Po and Zhen up until the \"big stink\" is good enough to maybe throw you off if you haven't seen it a dozen times already or if they hadn't spelled it out.\r\n\r\nPo's dads are fine.

We know this guy is meant to be an ex-marine because of the tagline but they make it seem like he's into some shady shit at the beginning of the movie, and no, I don't mean when he was detained at the very start.

Being a woke AF anti-theist (that's someone opposed to organized religion) I really liked the line: \"I don't know enough about the afterlife to trust in it, so while I'm here, [...] I gotta haunt these motherfuckers myself.\" That line was hard.\r\n3. The ending. They were building up to it throughout various scenes and I enjoyed watching it play out. I hope that was sufficiently vague enough to not spoil it.\r\n\r\nI initially rated this 8 stars with a favorite, but to offset those irrational 1 star ratings, I'm gonna give it 10.

Too much reverse \"show, don't tell\" and too many contrived scenes and one-liners.\r\n\r\nThe CGI is good, the costumes and set designs are good, the overall plot is good, but the writing falters often.\r\n\r\nI get that this is a PG-13 movie but teenage viewers aren't this dumb. Give them better writing. Maybe if we treat the younger generation like they have some intelligence, they'll start acting like it.\r\n\r\nThe end result is a movie that wastes its star power and the effort of all involved.\r\n\r\nVAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\n\r\n1. I get they were trying to do foreshadowing with the opening scene, but it ruined the \"reveal\". The birds were a nice thrilling scene that fell flat by us already being shown the antagonist.\r\n2. The \"V\" hallucination was just too silly. Elodie should have found the _evidance_ and had her own organic \"Tis a lie!\" reaction.\r\n3. It would have been nice to see Elodie wield a sword at some point before they left their kingdom, even if it was just her toting one in her introduction scene \"for wolves\" or some excuse. Take some hints from Brave (2012)'s Merida in the future for crying out loud.\r\n4. Sister's reaction to stepmother's concern felt forced.\r\n5. Stepmother's cut should have been a stab and she should have been in worse shape when she found Elodie. That scene also needed some work to make it less unbelievable. Like perhaps have Elodie make it back to the ship and find stepmother badly injured. Time skips are a thing that happens, y'know?\r\n6. Father's reasons could have been better written. Easily they could've had palace guards shadow him to imply he'd been threatened and then redone his rescue attempt. Why? Because he is never shown to be callous to the needs or feelings of his daughters. Their family being threatened would've made more sense than \"well I thought the sacrifice was worth it for the good of 'OUR' people\". Why they had him say \"my\" is anyone's guess.\r\n7. Less stoic one-liners and less stoic \"No! <*thrusts sword into ground*>\" moments. We've seen it numerous times and it's just utterly boring and contrived at this point.",

It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.",

They find themselves sentenced to “haunting” their former house where they try to scare the new wannabe swank couple out (Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara), but they find that their Goth daughter is more curious than scared (Winona Ryder). Michael Keaton plays the eponymous madcap “bio-exorcist” while Glenn Shadix is on hand as the new couple’s interior designer.\r\n\r\nThis was Burton’s debut on the silver screen and the first half is hilarious entertainment mixed with some interesting insights on the afterlife. The movie puts its best foot forward, but the second half isn’t as compelling and I think the title character is more annoying than amusing.    \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in beautiful East Corinth, Vermont, and (studio) Culver City, California.

Unfortunately, they & several others end up stuck in the barren areas of Southwest Africa with plenty of lions and hyenas roaming about.\r\n\r\n\"Prey\" (2024) was originally called “Kalahari,” but changed to the hackneyed “Prey.” The movie poster isn’t that far removed from the 2007 movie “Prey.” At heart, this is a modern take on “Sands of the Kalahari” and “Flight of the Pheonix” with a key element of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) thrown in. While this is the least of ’em due to its low-budget, it works well enough for a slow-burn survival adventure wherein the gore is more implied than shoved in your face. I prefer it to the 2007 version of “Prey.”\r\n\r\nThere's a factual error (the medical treatment of a particular wound), as well as a couple of seeming plot holes, but one of them can be easily explained on the grounds that a stray bullet struck the radiator of the jeep. A better explanation is that the jeep wasn't even there since one of the Namibians said something about waiting for the jeep to come back, possibly with another vehicle to transport the prisoners. The other potential plot hole can also be explained with a little imagination. The writer/director isn’t obligated to spell everything out and respects the intelligence of viewers to put the pieces together.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I’ve seen Hirsch play a bad boy and he’s convincing. I also liked the lowkey ideological struggle between good and evil, morality vs immorality, faith and atheism (or, at least, agnosticism), Christianity vs secular humanism. Speaking of which, it’s laughable that some people criticize the flick on the grounds of it being “Christian propaganda.” Two of the main characters are occupational missionaries, so it’s understood that God and faith will come up in a few of the dialogues. But, again, this is so light it’s hard to believe anyone would complain. The same came up in “The Grey,” but no one complained there.\r\n\r\nAs for a weather-related incident that occurs at the end, it doesn’t have to be attributed to a metaphysical source since freak things happen in the weather all the time. The film leaves you thinking about life’s heavy issues, like what’s your purpose? Is there a Creator? Is life a meaningless accident? Is there good and evil -- ethical and unethical -- or is everything relative? Is redemption possible for the morally compromised? Is there such a thing as self-sacrificial love (aka, agape)?      \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in the arid areas of the high country north of Los Angeles, such as SilverStrand Ranch, Castaic; Agua Dulce Movie Ranch; The Quarry in Semi Valley (for the sand sequence); MH Aviation in Lancaster; and Vasquez Rocks; as well as studio stuff done at Blackstone Entertainment, Azusa. A second unit filmed additional scenery and animals in South Africa, along with the use of stock footage.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

                "review": "Tolkien’s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. \r\n\r\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  \r\n\r\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

                "review": "Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        \r\n\r\nWhile I’m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then you’ll probably like these movies more than me. \r\n\r\n“The Return of the King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   \r\n\r\nLike the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. \r\n\r\nThen there are WAY too many “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché?    \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on. \r\n\r\nDespite these honest quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C",

Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) & Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around (Emile Hirsch). Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background, prepping to attack. \r\n\r\n“Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” (2019) is Quentin Tarantino’s 9th full film and, for me, ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre. It may not be as great as “Pulp Fiction” (1994) and “Django Unchained” (2012), but it places well with “Inglourious Basterds” (2009), “Jackie Brown” (1997) and “The Hateful Eight” (2015).  \r\n\r\nA famous director once succinctly defined a great movie as such: Three good scenes, no bad scenes. While the second part of this definition is debatable with \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,” seeing as how the movie could've certainly been tightened up (there are some dull sequences), there's no doubt that it fulfills the first part. \r\n\r\nMy three favorite scenes are: The amusing satirical Bruce Lee confrontation; the great Spahn Ranch episode, which effectively creates an underlying sense of menace; and, of course, the entertaining hippie attack in the final act.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are numerous additional gems: The friendship and respect of Rick and Cliff; the audacious flamethrower sequence; Rick's breakdown with the precocious girl actor (not actress); the beautiful women throughout; the great cast, including several celeb cameos; the entertaining soundtrack; Brandi, the pit bull; Rick's meltdown in his trailer; Rick finally pulling off a quality acting scene via ad libbing; George Spahn not remembering Cliff; everything (surprisingly) turning out to be precisely as so-and-so said; the allusion to what MAY have happened to Cliff's nagging wife (Rebecca Gayheart) on the boat; the way it should have turned out on that infamous night; and the heartwarming close,\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

William Sylvester plays an official of US Astronautics in the first hour while Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play the two functioning astronauts in the second half.\r\n\r\nCreated by Stanley Kubrick (director/writer) and Arthur C. Clarke (writer), \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is an artistic sci-fi film about human evolution, advanced technology, the wonders of space, the routineness of space travel, artificial intelligence and the mystery of extraterrestrial life. It mixes elements of “Planet of the Apes,” which debuted over six weeks earlier, with aspects of “Star Trek: The Motion Picture,” which came out eleven years later and was obviously influenced by this one-of-a-kind movie. \r\n\r\nIt begins with the “dawn of man” as a curious introduction before jumping forward to the 21st Century, which has been called the longest flash-forward in cinematic history. The depictions of space travel and life-in-space feel wholly authentic. \r\n\r\nBut “2001” is peculiar in that it rejects traditional techniques of narrative cinema and is often a nonverbal experience, which leaves some viewers in awe and others bored. It’s not about conventional thrills, but rather disquieting awe. It’s not easy entertainment, but meditative, transcendent art. The 1985 sequel, “2010: The Year We Make Contact,” is more standard and less ambiguous yet a worthy companion piece. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack mixes classical compositions, e.g. “Also Sprach Zarathustra” by Richard Strauss, with four creepy modernistic compositions by György Ligeti. The parts of the movie that utilize the latter pieces really evoke an unsettling sense of the unknown.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part is the astronauts’ exchange with HAL, which involves almost an hour of the runtime and is the only part of the film that generates a low-key sense of suspense.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don’t believe that humankind began as apes (rolling my eyes). But, even if this were true, where did the apes come from? Did they just spontaneously manifest by accident? If so, when? How? Biogenesis is a scientific axiom meaning “life proceeds from life.” So what life form originally created the apes or the simple organisms that supposedly evolved into apes?\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+",

The surviving ‘Fellowship’ of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour.  \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there’s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there’s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they’re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest.

                "review": "WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2014, \"Fury\" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. \r\n\r\nWriter/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent \"Training Day.\" In \"Fury\" he successfully shows the soldiers’ view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970) perhaps comes closest.\r\n\r\nI mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001) or \"Man of Steel\"(2013)? \"Fury\" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Peña). \r\n\r\n'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.\r\n\r\nBeyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day \"Fury\" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), \"The Eagle has Landed\" (1976), \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), and \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); \"Fury\" is leagues better IMHO. \r\n\r\nThe melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of \"Fury,\" but I get the point of that sequence.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

                "review": "***Tribute to a real-life WW2 “conscientious collaborator”*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss’ potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and “Hacksaw Ridge” is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding “Platoon” (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn’t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one’s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren’t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple – throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They’re wrong. Sometimes it’s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

He and his fellow guards become intrigued by the gentle giant and conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. Who, then, is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.\r\n\r\n\"The Green Mile\" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not), DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; it's by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.\r\n\r\nRunning 3-hours, it's over my limited attention span, and yet it's somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. It's character/dialogue driven, unique and unpredictable. Don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is a powerful supernatural mystery/drama.\r\n\r\n**SPOILER ALERT** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey)\r\n\r\nJohn Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means \"winged creature.\" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty.

(4) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse \"Mr. Jingles.\"\r\n\r\n**End SPOILER ALERT**\r\n\r\nDon't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece.",

Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers’ seriously concerned doctor.\r\n\r\nJohn Carpenter’s “Halloween” (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, “Halloween” was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963), “A Bay of Blood” (1971) “Torso (1973), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and “Black Christmas” (1974). “Friday the 13th” (1980) and its sequels took the “Halloween” template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.\r\n\r\nWhilst I prefer the “Friday” films, “Halloween” has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt “The Slumber Party Massacre” (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as “Friday the 13th Part 3” (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What’s NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it’s not late October.\r\n\r\nOther problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls’ conversation walking home from school, which doesn’t ring true. Speaking of the girls, they’re decent, but not nearly as good as the “Friday” films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in “Psycho”). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers’ abode speaking portentously.\r\n\r\nI appreciate “Halloween” because it’s classy, atmospheric and it’s a flick pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it’s a tad overrated by gushing fans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Henry Rollins plays the Drill Instructor-like host of the show.\r\n\r\n“Wrong Turn 2: Dead End” (2007) is the first of many sequels in the franchise about cannibalistic hillbillies in Appalachia. The reason \"Deliverance\" (1972) is so iconic and unsettling is because the story actually COULD happen. The first “Wrong Turn” film from 2003 started out this way but became increasingly unbelievable as the story progressed. As such, it was entertaining and compelling but not genuinely scary. \r\n\r\nThis one adds some overt camp and goofiness while increasing the gore factor. It may well be the goriest film ever made at the time of its release. And it is entertaining to a point, despite the disgusting elements (not just gore, but sleaze as well), yet it’s not truly chilling because it’s so over-the-top it’s cartoonish.  \r\n\r\nStill, Rollins does well as the gung-ho host and a few of the protagonists emerge as likable people worthy of surviving. Unfortunately, the most agreeable character is one of the first to buy the farm. I’m of course not taking about the annoying Kimberly Caldwell in the opening, although what happens to her is amusing in a “shocking” black humor kind of way.\r\n\r\nPetite Aleksa Palladino (Mara) stands out on the feminine front. Crystal Lowe (Elena) is alluring but her character is a loathsome skank. Erica Leerhsen (Nina), who was a highlight as the Wiccan lass in \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" (2000), still looks good, but has unfortunately lost weight and looks stick-like.\r\n\r\nThe mutant hicks are well done, but most of them look like Klingons from Star Trek from back in the day, just uglier.\r\n\r\nWhile “Wrong Turn 2” has some entertainment value, it’s so excessive in its attempt to be revolting & amusing it loses impact.

Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

Now the argument can be made it's the worst in the modern era of superhero movies, though personally it's \"better\" than Suicide Squad but even that one had costumed heroes in it versus MW which only had maybe a few minutes of the ladies in their costumes and even then, it's via future visions.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, nothing really works. The direction, even with the twisty-turny camera movements felt familiar as I'm pretty sure I've seen it done before but minimally. The performances from everyone was either bland, Dakota Johnson especially, or downright awful (Tahar Rahim), not helped by the stilted and oft atrocious dialogue from no less than four writers, two of which were responsible for Morbius.\r\n\r\nI didn't hate Madame Web more so that I found it downright dull and boring. There's no reason to watch this and with the terrible box office, the last line of \"And you know the best thing about the future? It hasn't happened yet\" is pretty poignant. **2.0/5**",

                "review": "\"Beetlejuice\" will undoubtedly be difficult to surpass certainly in terms of pure visual imagination which incorporates some sets skewered at desperately crazy angles and outrageously cluttered administrative areas and waiting rooms where you can literally sit in monotonous silence for months at a time while listening to muzak. Tim Burton excels marvellously behind the cameras to deliver what is probably one of the most quirky films to come along in recent decades. His unique visuals strive to achieve an almost Georges Melies quality to them as Burton places all manner of incredible visual marvels on the screen and they are given an added dimension with generous splashes of garish colour all over the place. This film is unquestionably an amusing and appealing piece of entertainment and it is difficult to see how it could possibly be bettered and anyone would be certifiably insane to even try.",

                "review": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" adopts a change of pace probably because the filmmakers have obviously deemed \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984) much too dark (and perhaps completely unpalatable in some quarters) for most audiences who thrilled at the exciting derring-do of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981). This current outing is much more audience friendly and it gets the delicate balance just right to create a heady mix of thrills and spills which results in a breathless whirlwind adventure during its action packed two hours. Steven Spielberg is certainly on tremendous form as he skillfully pieces together superbly executed action scene after action scene. He also makes extensive use of a tank in much the same way as he did the boat \"Orca\" in the blockbusting \"Jaws\" (1975) and he effortlessly finds a seemingly inexhaustible array of fresh camera angles to capture every second of the unfolding and fast moving action.",

But there's only real development between those two by the end, nobody else.\r\n\r\nAnd the casting is quite bad as well because none of the actors really sell me on their performance, just seems they're phoning it in. The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.\r\n\r\nHow can a Garfield movie truly be done? After seeing this I have little hope for Garfield movies in the future. But the idea of Garfield being in a movie is outlandish and quite hard to make a feasible plot without introducing lame characters. This franchise is hard to make acceptable for fans since it will never live up to what Garfield truly is. But to give us an hour and a half of our time with him for a outlandish, out of this world, story is enough regardless of how bad it might be, because it will never work out.",

As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

Good to see Chris Tucker back and boy he just gets his sense of humor right each time. The banters between Matt and Chris Messina is the highlight for me. Ben Affleck is a master in terms of direction, the way he manages veterans into building such a collaboration is astounding. \r\n\r\nOverall, If you believe in uplifting stories behind sports and redefining moments of history which changed the world we live in today then Air is a great addition to your watchlist. \r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

I deeply felt the absence of Cameron Boyce, who played Carlos. The tribute to him at the beginning, showing his picture and seeing the tears on Uma's (China Anne McClain) face, was incredibly moving and a beautiful way to honor his memory.\r\nDespite the changes, the new characters brought fresh energy to the story. Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts was a standout with her deliciously malevolent portrayal. I loved seeing her in this role; she brought a unique flair and intensity that made her character unforgettable. Another highlight was Red (Kylie Cantrall), who added a dynamic presence to the story and felt like a natural fit in the Descendants universe.\r\nThe plot was engaging, the music fantastic, and the choreography spectacular. The film stayed true to the spirit of the Descendants while exploring new directions.\r\nOverall, Descendants 4 was a satisfying continuation of the beloved series. It balanced the bittersweet emotions of missing the original cast with the excitement of new adventures. This movie is a must-watch for any Descendants fan and a beautiful tribute to Cameron Boyce's legacy.**",

The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\r\n\r\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \r\n\r\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\r\n\r\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\r\n\r\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\r\n\r\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn’t select it, so I gave it 2/10.",

Great voice acting, great songs without having the burden of exposition via song that you find in the more musical ventures by Disney.  I loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.  None of that in this animated gem.\r\n\r\nOne thing I personally loved was the depiction of Mexican culture.  Although I really enjoyed _Moana_, I thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple Pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (Maori) and stuck with it.  _Coco_ celebrates Mexican culture, and depicts it well.  The only thing missing for me was more Mexican cuisine.\r\n\r\nIt can get a little dark in places, so maybe be careful when watching it with the little ones, but should appeal to most of the family.\r\n\r\n9/10",

Though I do prefer other movies like _Revolver, Doomsday and Donnie Darko_ to it, with those I can always understand when people don’t see in them what I do. With _30 Days of Night_, if you don’t have a problem with gore, then you shouldn’t have a problem with the film. And yet I have personal friends as well as people I’ve heard from online who totally dig horror, gore, vampires etc. and yet don’t like _30 Days of Night_, which confuses me all to Hell, let me tell you.\r\n\r\nThough I was mildly aggravated by the inconstancies in the number of vampires around, other than that I can find virtually nothing bad to say about _30 Days of Night_. Firstly you have Josh Hartnett (_The Faculty_) as Sheriff Eben, protagonist, secondly you have Danny Huston (_The Proposition_) as Marlow, leader of the vampires, who attack Alaska during the winter period of 30 days without sun (which in and of itself is an awesome concept, and thirdly there’s Ben Foster (_Pandorum_) as the vampire’s human lapdog, all of whom are personal favourites of mine. That’s not even mentioning the fact that Eben’s wife is played by Australian Melissa George (_Triangle_), who was born in my hometown, so even if she wasn’t a great actor, she’d get auto-points.\r\n\r\nBasically every point in which _30 Days of Night_ differentiates from the comic it’s based on is an improvement to the story, which is (gasp, shock, horror) a mildly realistic Vampire film. God forbid. I love the vampires in this. Though they’re not quite as sexy and well-dressed as they are in _Underworld _or as demonic as they are in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, they bring a totally new brutality to the vampire class. They wear what you’d expect late 30-ish people living in 2007 to wear, they’re stronger than the average human, but not impossibly so, they hunt in packs and give off bloodcurdling, atavistic shrieks (of which I give quite a good impression; sidenote) they’re unrelenting an animalistic but just as intelligent as a regular person, they’re quick, dark and deadly.\r\n\r\nThere’s no camp to be found here, not always a good thing, but in _30 Days of Night_, it is. I honestly cannot recommend this one enough, despite its intense gore and general panning, I implore you to at the very least give it a go, and decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nBoth the human survivors and the vampire invaders are there simply trying to stay alive, the vamps through their sadistic, systematic hunting of the local populace for their food-source, blood, and the people by trying to both hide, and fight back, but mostly the former. Ironically, it’s the “humanity” of the humans that causes every one of their downfalls, while they’re leached from above by a far superior race, who goes so far as to call humans a “plague” and invent a new language all for themselves, just so as to not have to speak the same filthy way we lower-beings do (and I mean, if your choice was between that and having to put up with American-English, wouldn’t you?).\r\n\r\n86%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

                "review": "**A long format review from 2012**\r\n\r\nMy new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;\r\n\r\n1. The Avengers\r\n2. Iron Man\r\n3. Thor\r\n4. Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!\r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._",

                "review": "**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2011.**\r\n\r\nIn the vein of films like _The Punisher_ and _Mad Max_, _The Crow_ first hit my screen only four years ago, way back when my DVD collection consisted of only about 40 films, (now it is around 500). I had $10 to my name but I was intent on expanding the thing, a girl I'd met only that day, suggested I buy it from Sanity, when there used to be one in Civic. Since that day, when I was well and truly blown away by it, we've always intended to make our tradition of \"Crow and Coffee\" (wherein you watch _The Crow_ and drink several litres of Ice Coffee & Bailey's) a repeated thing.\r\n\r\nI feel as if this one should have been known to me for far longer than it has. It's quite a point of shame in the Goth community to have none been raised on the shit. And I can tell why. The film blends some of the most incredible bands out (The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Violent Femmes, Pantera), is filled with great actors, it's based on one of the best comics I've ever had the good fortune of reading, and it's overshadowed by the death of the actor playing lead protagonist Eric Draven, Brandon Lee, son of martial arts master Bruce Lee.\r\n\r\n_The Crow_ is filled with the dark and ominous. Towards the end, Draven fights using a martial arts move that was performed in honour of Brandon Lee's father, Bruce Lee, when he used an identical style in _Enter the Dragon_, the last film his father ever starred in, before his untimely death. In another scene, Draven can be seen filling a gun-barrel up with metal, and shooting them out into a pawn shop, Brandon Lee was killed on set during filming, when a metal casing became lodged in a gun that was then expelled by a blank, fatally wounding Lee in the torso. Behind the scenes, on the first day of shooting a carpenter suffered sever burns on set after his crane hit power lines. Later, a grip truck caught fire, an angry sculpting employee crashed his car through the set's plaster shop and another member of the crew accidentally impaled his own hand with a screwdriver. According to the biography of Bruce Lee, Brandon's death was predicted by his father after awakening from a coma, he foresaw Brandon's death long before he had even considered taking up acting, supposedly.\r\n\r\nBy no accounts is _The Crow_ unpredictable, it's rather the opposite, but it makes up for this in so many ways! It notches up some of the best quotes in film history, as well as being badass, and yet so utterly convincingly emotional. There is essentially no demographic I can think of that wouldn't enjoy (at least a little) this dark film's gothic atmosphere, gritty hopelessness, world-changing special effects, riveting action, and well-deserved cult status.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I’m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI won’t harp on too much, because I don’t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn’t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It’s not the best superhero film of all time, it’s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it’s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that’s what’s important here. But what do I mean by that? \r\n\r\nWell, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. \r\n\r\nEvery new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.\r\n\r\nSo if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they’ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that’s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It’s what’s not in _Age of Ultron_ that’s the problem.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I’m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can’t say it more plainly than that: It’s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn’t stand alone the first film did. It’s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can’t fully get behind it.\r\n\r\nThat all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can’t state that enough. And there’s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I’m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

                "review": "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nMarking the beginning of the latest Marvel franchise, _The Avengers_, is Jon Favreau's _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Super Hero movies, I don't love them to the same extent that I do the slasher or psychological thriller genres, but they do hold a small place in my heart all to themselves. I'm pretty pumped for this whole \"Avengers\" thing to come to fruition, 'cause honestly it's all been great so far, starting with Iron Man, whom Robert Downey Jr. (_Natural Born Killers, Gothika, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, Due Date_) portrays, and incredibly so.\r\n\r\nIt's important to set yourself a starting point. More specifically, what I mean is, a reason. Batman's parents were murdered, and his home was destroyedby crime; The Punisher's whole family was murdered in front of him and he big-time snapped; characters like the X-Men and the Fantastic 4 are defending themselves and end up having a penchant for world-saving. Those are all fine, and so long as you have one, I'm happy. But I really kind of like Tony Stark's reason for becoming Iron Man... He's a dick. That's why. He's a dick that supplies the world with the most lethal weapons in existence, and they take lives left, right and centre. Then, he's put through the world where they get used, and finally is told by the person who helped him escape that world, not to waste his life. He believes he is still alive for a reason, he decides that reason is to become a dick that is intent on privatising world peace. Which I think makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nThat may have come across as sarcasm, but I was deadly serious. Tony Stark becomes Iron man, and that's why. It works fantastically. We then get to see all the incarnations of his suit, how difficult it was to make, what it runs on, the technology, everything. And I'm a huge fan of back story, which Iron Man delivers.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of the antithesis of DC's _Batman Begins_. Though they're both young adults that come from money with no family, a British butler (although Iron man's butler Jarvis was transformed into AI for the film [he was an actual person in the comics]), they have a board of directors take care of their family's billionaire business until they're ready to eventually take the reins, they both become \"____ Man\" and go about saving the innocent, not through superpowers but technology. I'm sure I could go on. But they're also incredibly different. Where Batman is a total bad ass, the gothic unknown defender of the night that uses fear as a weapon to protect his home town, and yet refuses to kill; Iron Man is a bright, shiny, loud attention grabber, who goes all international to fight crime, he wants the world to know he's Iron Man and his enemies are totally lame, so no wonder he has no qualms about killing! Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is an angsty tosser, that tries way to hard. But Tony Stark, is a witty, brilliant inventor, who has basically harnessed all of Batman's training, strength, weapons, vehicles and flight, improved them, and put them in to a single suit. So though I personally prefer Batman as a hero, I prefer Tony Stark as a character.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between Stark and Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (_Se7en, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Royal Tenenbaums, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_) was incredible. It just goes to show what good casting can achieve, even in an action flick, the dialogue is hilarious and clever. Is it possible for a Super Hero movie to be a bad Super Hero film but a great film? I guess it is.\r\n\r\nThe antagonists are lacking to say the least, and their dispatching leaves even more to be desired. Which is normally not too huge when you get the rest so perfect, unfortunately, it's a comic book film, about Super Heroes, and Super Villains. They fight one another over and over, in fact that's pretty much what the comics are about in their entirety, so it's quite a major short coming. That being said, it's really the only one that _Iron Man_ has. In a way though, they're a similar comparison to the latest Batman films again; Iron Monger and Whiplash are flashy, but disappointing, where The Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul are top notch as bad guys. Whereas Ironman's Obadiah Stane and Ivan Vanko were great characters, but Batman's The Joker is only seen in his villain persona, and Harvey Dent, Jonathan Crane and Henri Ducard are nothing more than vessels for their alter-egos.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, the film is just plain good, and you don't need to be a fan of Iron Man, Super Heroes or comics in general to enjoy _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\n82%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Pretty fucking good considering it hasn’t even been released in America yet, where like, every movie ever makes most of its money. As you may have guessed, yes, I did finally get around to seeing le Thor, hence the delay in my review of The Incredible Hulk. But know what? Fuck you man! I just watched fucking Thor!!\r\n\r\nSo in case you couldn’t guess, I was rather damn impressed with it all. Why? Well boys and girls, strap your tolerance boots on, this one could get long.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Graphics were some of the best I’ve ever seen. Now I’m not one to believe that CGI is the sort of thing that could make or break a film, but having it be this fantastic goes quite a ways to helping out. I also was unfortunate in my having to watch it in 3D, and yet it was worth it. This is a pretty big statement from me. I despise 3D… I even walked out of the cinema not feeling nauseous. A tad headache-y sure, but that was it. So congrats Thor.\r\n\r\nThe comic relief was powerful. In that “funny but not silly” kind of way. I mean, it’s all a bit silly, but it would have been so easy to fall into the cheesy trap with this film. The writing team and director Kenneth Branagh (The Boat that Rocked, Sleuth, Hamlet) did a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged  and not descending too far into shameless, lame, self-parody.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the film were written almost as strongly as they were in Iron Man 1 & 2, not quite, but they did have quite a number more to work through, so they couldn’t work with everyone as well as they did with Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. They also managed to totally pull off an American movie with romance and comedy, in a way that totally avoided those awful American Romantic Comedies (my least favourite genre in the history of ever).\r\n\r\nThere’s this whole thing where Thor comes from another world. Which was after all really the only way you could bring a God into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has been so grounded in reality. And I’ll tell you, Asgard (Thor’s home planet) was fucking great. They pulled off this crazy similarities in appearance between family members on Asgard, despite the fact that none of the actors are related. You may disagree with me on inspection of posters and whatnot, but after seeing the movie, you’ll get what I mean. Also the actors they got to play the younger Loki and Thor were eerily believable. Like, to an actually kind of scary point. I wonder if any of it was fake… The Frost Giant homeworld of Jotunheim is also visually stunning.\r\n\r\nThe sound effects were very confronting. I couldn’t really figure out if I though this was a good or a bad thing… It’ll be interesting to rewatch on DVD, and see if it was only so crazy because of the speakers in the theatre. Thor may have lacked the wholeness as a film felt by Iron Man 1 & 2, or The Incredible Hulk, but it was perfect as a lead up to The Avengers, which, now that it’s all set in stone, is really kind of needed. With Thor more than the other heroes it’s the most important, because there was really no way to humanise that sort of character, he’s just so outlandish that you really need an entire film just to ground him in this world they’re developing.\r\n\r\nBut all of the things I’ve had to say about the film were basically leading up to this one big thing; the cast! The cast was incredible, not only did they manage to snag a total of THREE of my favourite underrated actors ever, one of them just so happened to my favourite actor in the whole wide world, Ray Stevenson!\r\n\r\nWe have Australian (fuck yes Australia!) Chris Hemsworth (Home and Away [Hey! We all have to start somewhere, right?], A Perfect Getaway, Ca$h, Cabin in the Woods) playing Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, V For Vendetta) playing Thor’s love interest; Jane Foster (lots of people have started having a problem with Natalie Portman nowadays, but I still love her), Anthony Hopkins (The Rite, The Wolfman, Beowulf, Red Dragon, Hannibal, The Silence of the Lambs [Yes, this is the same guy who played Hannibal Lecter. I fucking know, right!?] Bram Stroker’s Dracula) as Thor’s father; Odin, Stellan Skarsgard (King Arthur, Exorcist: The Beginning, Beowulf & Grendel, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Angels & Demons) as Dr. Erik Selvig; Jane Foster’s mentor, Ray Stevenson (Rome, King Arthur, Outpost, Punisher: War Zone, The Book of Eli) as Thor’s friend, and member of the Warriors Three (above); Volstagg, Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T., The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, 28 Weeks Later, The Hurt Locker, The Town) as Hawkeye; the S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter, and Samuel L. Jackson (The Exorcist III, Jurassic Park, Jackie Brown, Shaft, Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, S.W.A.T., Snakes on a Plane, 1408,  Cleaner, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; General Nick Fury… And those are just the actors I already adore.\r\n\r\nI’ve now also grown quite attached to Tom Hiddleston (Wallander) who plays Loki, Thor’s brother, and the main antagonist, as well as Joshua Dallas (Doctor Who and The Descent Part II) who plays another of the Warriors Three (above), and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist and Defendor) who plays D’arcy Lewis; Jane Foster’s friend and colleague.\r\n\r\nAs I always like to say, I watched this film in a theatre (Belcompton, shit, uh, Belconnen, Hoyts to be specific). I really think this film has lasting value, but it’s important to note that I almost always feel a film is enhanced when watched on the big screen, especially with Action films, effects films, epic films and franchise films. Thor happens to be all of those things. I was especially excited waiting for the post-credits scene to come up in that huge cinema. So please take into consideration that I reviewed this on the silver screen, if you happen to be watching it on DVD or BluRay or some such. Because you better of not fucking downloaded it!!  Damn scum…\r\n\r\n80%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

If you've read many enough my reviews to get any sort of indication as to the sort of cinema I am in to, then you could be forgiven for assuming I wouldn't be a fan. After all, _Mean Girls_ is about as far away from my wheelhouse as a movie could conceivably be. But I fucking **love** it. And I honestly can't tell you why. Every single piece of _Mean Girls_ examined in isolation, is something I despise. Every trope, formula, format, cliche, device and style choice is something I have ragged on a hundred times before in different reviews, but for whatever reason, I cannot put _Mean Girls_ down. I don't think a single year has gone by since I first saw it in the late '00s that I haven't rewatched it. Usually, multiple times a year. Inexplicable, but there it is.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._",

                "review": "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nI find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\r\n\r\nWhen films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are \"Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it.\" Very classy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.\r\n\r\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; \"Congratulations sir, you have created a new element\", is a little flawed.\r\n\r\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.\r\n\r\n63%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

I was a Batman-kid through and through, so as hard as a decision as it was to make, I decided I wouldn't be back to watch this run of DC movies, because for me, it was three swings, three misses.\r\n\r\nEnter _Wonder Woman_ earlier this year. Though I had decided to not give this film series any more of money, I went back on my word and watched it opening weekend. Half \"one-last-hail-Mary\" and half \"I don't mind voting with my money to see more female-led superhero movies\". I loved it so much, that I was instantly back on the DC universe train.\r\n\r\nNow we have _Justice League_.\r\n\r\nI like to rank franchises according to my personal tastes. When it comes to what I refer to as the \"DCIThoughtSheWasWithU\" I dislike _Man of Steel_, _BVS_ & _Suicide Squad_ all roughly the same amount for different reasons, so it's tough to work out which comes in second place, which is third an which is fourth.

The absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within Venom himself (between Brock and the Symbiote) and the movie would have been a lot worse if Tom Hardy wasn't capable of pulling that off.

I know that they also spoil the twist about who's a Terminator and who's not and who's a bad guy and who's not in the trailers for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th too, but I'm pretty sure that in the Good Timeline those never got made, so whatever.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal.

Firstly, any restrictions he had in acting ability back in the 80s are brushed aside by the fact that he's playing a cold, unfeeling machine. And can you imagine someone who looks like that coming after you? Forget the fact he's got an arsenal in his back pocket, forget the fact that he's got a near unstoppable metal exoskeleton, Arnie is already a machine!

They took some risks with their casting and it didn’t explode in their face which is nice, a lot of the effects were very visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again, but these aren’t things that make a good movie by themselves.

The CGI was often so bad it was confronting, even in the climax of the film. Apocalypse's plan was plot-hole-y and underdeveloped, and not all of the new characters hit it out of the park.\r\n\r\nThere was still a lot to like here though. Some of the newer costumes were neat, and a lot of the side-plots had me very intrigued. Fassbender and McAvoy are excellent as always. It's certainly not a failure amongst the likes of, for example, _X-Men: The Last Stand_. Which was a good callout in _Apocalypse_.

Though receiving less critical acclaim than Captain Phillips or Gravity, it did clean up in the finance department.\r\n\r\nI’ve made no secret of the fact that in the MCU, my favourite Avenger is Thor, so a new film was always going to be an easy ticket from me. And I can’t work out if that bias is making me more critical of the film because I care so much, or less because I’m just happy it got made? I’ll try to be as above board as possible.\r\n\r\nThor 2 is a spectacle, make no mistake. It has the appropriate mix of explosions, attractive people, monsters, humour, fighting, mesmerising visuals, sweet symbolism and heart-wrenching sorrow that can be expected from a decent super hero film. But beyond that, it doesn’t really have much.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds like it has a lot, and it honestly does, but I just couldn’t help feeling in a quite a number of moments that the thing felt hurried. Maybe if there wasn’t such a mad rush to get a Thor sequel out by the end of 2013, they could have spent a little more time fleshing out and filling in the script (not that it’s a short movie, I mean the pre-production feels rushed) and better utilising director Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones, Rome, Carnivale). There was a hint of the generic, amongst this otherwise splendid film.\r\n\r\n73%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r\n\r\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore).

These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie.

I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.\r\n\r\nDisney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like \"lizard footman eats a fly\", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nWhile I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.\r\n\r\nThe casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development.  Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about \"Kit\" was a rather inspired thing.\r\n\r\nI understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays \"stuck up snoot\" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us \"the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat\" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care.  It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.\r\n\r\nSophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).\r\n\r\nFor some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job.  I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.\r\n\r\nWhat makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James.  She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.  \r\n\r\nCinderella is traditionally a \"fairest in the land\" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair.  Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match.  Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do).  It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points.  It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself.",

I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.\r\n\r\nThis is a fascinating premise.  A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are \"World War Z\" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.\r\n\r\nThere is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.\r\n\r\nThe one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.  It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.\r\n\r\nThis movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints.",

This movie is filled with insensitive nonsense, particularly to Native Americans, and the majority of the characters are just awful people, to include Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.  Wendy is the only \"pure\" character in the entire movie, and I feel as if I'm reaching there.  Tiger Lily might be a competitor, but she doesn't DO much, so it's hard to tell.\r\n\r\nWith such a wonderful premise, and Disney's level of production value, you would think this would hold up, even after 70 years, but I honestly am beginning to think this was so widely accepted for a lack of options.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the actual story is both \"close enough\" to the original story, and well enough structured that a reboot would probably be very close to this version.  It's all stylistic choices in both animation, dialogue, and character presentation that could easily be cleaned up, and likely should have been.\r\n\r\nWhile I could probably rant for an hour just on the \"love\" triangle happening in this (I am completely in camp Tinkerbell), this is supposed to be \"boy who never grew up\".   While that lends to the jealousy factors, the amount and inconsistency of details on everything about the place being magical tends to distract from it.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that Peter no longer has human ears, he has pixie ears, and the boys supposedly killed and skinned giant animals so they could wear their skins as pajamas: where are the rest of the animals?\r\n\r\nThe pirates have been there long enough to get restless, though there are enough of them left, despite Hook just shooting them dead on occasion, but not long enough to mutiny or properly search the one island, but long enough to have a weirdly specific history between Peter Pan and Hook and the crocodile.\r\n\r\nIt's a weird movie: it's still worth a watch, but I'd watch it with your kids as opposed to just on their own.",

It almost is just a highlight of the ridiculous lengths that Nazi's went to look for weird resources: the occult (\"Hellboy\"), artifacts, and investigations into alien contact.\r\n\r\nThis is a return to quality though, it takes up the more serious atmosphere of the first movie and with that concentrates on a dramatically good action adventure movie.\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite of the franchise.",

(And I'm a fan of the \"Star Trek\" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot.\" \r\n\r\nA band of \"space truckers\" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic \"Exomorph.\" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other \"space monster\" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as \"near pornographic,\" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's \"worst nightmare\" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the \"Prometheus\" prequel.(?)",

Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lt. Gorman visit her, saying contact has been lost with LV-426. Signing a devil's deal with Weyland-Yutani, Ripley boards the \"Sulaco\" with a \"company\" of Colonial Marines. To her horror, an android, \"Bishop\" is part of the crew, recalling the murderous \"Nostromo\" science officer, Ash. The trash-talking Colonial Marines give Ripley's tale short shrift, as they prepare for the \"Bug Hunt.\" The armed-to-the-teeth party finds no colonists, but evidence of a battle to the death. Then something streaks out of hiding, pursued by Ripley. \"Mewt\" is the sole survivor of \"Hadley's Hope\" who views the soldiers with a disdainful \"it won't make any differene.\" A computer search finds the colonists clustered deep below the power plant.\r\nThe Marines descend into the sub-sub-basement level and find out how true Ripley's tale is. After retreating from Hell, the survivors seal themselves off from the \"Xenomorphs\" as best as they can, dispatching \"Bishop\" to bring down the other drop ship. The Aliens attack and the soldiers fall one after another, leading to an abduction and a face off in an egg-filled chamber. This sequel is superior to the first movie, and leads to \"Ripley and the Convicts.\" 8/10.",

It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.\r\n\r\nThe space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",

                "review": "Some birds aren't meant to be caged.\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",

But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.\r\n\r\nThe characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious \"who done it\" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.\r\n\r\nOwls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10",

Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...\r\n\r\nHow do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!\r\n\r\nThey mostly come at night - mostly.\r\n\r\nWhere Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God). \r\n\r\nThematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10",

It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable.

In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.\r\n\r\nIt's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.\r\n\r\nIt's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun. This is the reason why Pirates had few peers at the time of its release, for it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously. The audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, they are having fun because so is the film and so is, crucially, the impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley (perfectly cast), Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the very least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place.

Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.\r\n\r\nAs most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford's (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that \"Jacket\" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private \"Joker's\" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.\r\n\r\nThen it's that second half...\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? We already know that \"Joker\" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the \"Boot Camp\" set up. Modine's (who isn't strong enough to carry the picture) \"Joker\" is now the film's axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by \"Joker\".\r\n\r\nFull Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10",

                "review": "View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.\r\n\r\nOk lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think \"Indiana Jones\", \"National Treasures\" like adventures (hell even \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.\r\n\r\nThere's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the sexy vicious teasers they are.\r\n\r\nProduction is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Penélope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10",

                "review": "Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!\r\n\r\nYear four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! \r\n\r\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. \r\n\r\nAs is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.\r\n\r\nA film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10",

Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that \"you know who\" is not back again.\r\n\r\nGiven that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.\r\n\r\nNew into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.\r\n\r\nRoll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10",

That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord. \r\n\r\nThe Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skilful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills. \r\n\r\nAll told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10 ",

It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore.

While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.\r\n\r\nPotter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.\r\n\r\nA filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10",

In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.\r\n\r\nNew additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!\r\n\r\nTension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10",

The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M.

So with that I give it a personal rating of 10/10, it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts, then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10, what's not to like here?\r\n\r\nThe film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam, a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy, the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be, tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke & Jesse Ventura, these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic, and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel, and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time, whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this \"hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator\" to life, none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infa-red shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts, that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title, but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind; so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nEnjoy 10/10",

He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!\r\n\r\nIt's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!\r\n\r\nHere for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into \"The Battle of Branston Bridge\", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.\r\n\r\nThe Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.\r\n\r\nThere's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!\r\n\r\nFrom the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10",

                "review": "Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can.\r\n\r\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. \r\n\r\nPeter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers. \r\n\r\nWhile the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of \"fans\" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think. \r\n\r\nI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the \"reimaging\" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that \"reimaging\" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! \r\n\r\nNegatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin \"origin\" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. \r\n\r\nHowever, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. \r\n\r\nIt's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10",

Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.\r\n\r\nThematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a \"It's a Wonderful Life\" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!\r\n\r\nThe action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10",

Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.\r\n\r\nNo doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen \"The Party Crasher\" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved.

All the makers have done here (apart from attempting to kill off the franchise it seems) is splice together various staples from the other films in the series. Be it the settings or confrontations, they have just upped the blood quota, the film has no substance what so ever. Characters so dense and unlikeable you root for the monsters by way of having no choice, dumb teens in angst, Rambo mom, ex-convict trying to do good, you name it and chances are you have seen it in other rubbish murder death kill movies. \r\n\r\nThere is gore galore which I'm sure will appease the easily pleased, and in one particularly monstrous scene involving a pregnant woman, a sequence for the squeamish to chat on the playground about come Monday morning.

The only hope Earth has is something called the fifth element, which comes in the form of the newly cloned Leeloo. Along with an ex forces cab driver and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before the end of mankind arrives.\r\n\r\nDepending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a child! Here in lies the problem that many critics and movie watchers can't agree on. Just what does Luc Besson's film want to be? Having conceived the concept for his film at a very early age, Besson I think waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes- cartoonish in every other frame.\r\n\r\nCrucial though is that Besson's futuristic vision of New York dominates proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take aways anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food, how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final third.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged roles (Twelve Monkeys) to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives a memorable performance (oh my, is that a Southern American accent?), but it's with Mila Jovovich (Leeloo) that the film gets its acting spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has failed to progress in the acting world? (stop doing tripe like Resident \"will work for food\" Evil films would be a good start).\r\n\r\nSci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features Ian Holm (Alien) and Brion James (Blade Runner), which off sets the annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby Rhod (is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?). To leave us with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to his heart over his head, but hey baby, it's one groovy and enjoyable romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10",

Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.\r\n\r\nWomen impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10",

It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. It's place in the pantheon of science fiction films is assured, its influence on the genre undoubted, while the lead cast members cemented themselves in the sci-fi hall of fame.\r\n\r\nNo more needs to be said really, The Terminator is a kinetic live action comic book of a movie, classy movie making, paced to precision and featuring a story that's brilliantly complex and utterly compelling. 9/10",

An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben \"Obi-Wan\" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\r\n\r\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",

It’s that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It’s grade “A” film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.\r\n\r\nThe story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi’s non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It’s often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder. \r\n\r\nIt’s not romanticism here, if anything it’s a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s.

Of course if this was merely a stand alone film, where there was no Alien and Aliens previously, I feel sure the special edition cut would be thought of differently. \r\n\r\nA roll call of Brit thesps line up for some tension filled entertainment as director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson provide a look that is both beautiful and scary. The metallic nightmare of chambers and cold concrete fused together for some hellish stalk and paranoia. Industrial Punk? Steam Punk? Cyber Punk? Fincher Punk? Hey man, we gotta give it a name! And of course there's Siggy Weaver front and center, the reassuring presence among the murderers, rapists and child molesters. \r\n\r\nI could live without the attempt at a transcendent finale, but in extended form this has much to light your fires.

This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store.

It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).\r\n\r\nIt's true to say that \"Indiana Jones\" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post \"Indiana Jones\", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. \"The Mummy\" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's \"Indiana Jones\" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's  ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10",

It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.\r\n\r\nHaving been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\r\n\r\n\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"\r\n\r\nSeven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\r\n\r\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10",

                "review": "Earth Angel And The Nuclear DeLorean.\r\n\r\nIt's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.\r\n\r\nIt's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock \"n\" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it's the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.\r\n\r\nMade for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can't argue with. It's snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don't like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10",

                "review": "Raiders Of The Last Crusade.\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves. \r\n\r\nWe didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be. \r\n\r\nIn 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic). \r\n\r\nI mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. \r\n\r\nIn comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure. \r\n\r\nMade for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10",

                "movie_countries": "United States, India",
                "review": "No splitting this Atom, it has got a rock solid heart.\r\n\r\nReal Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.\r\n\r\nSet in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....\r\n\r\nWe can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clichés that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's very much perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are still young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's the robot Atom, the people's champion, yes it's David vS Goliath and yes! It's Balboa vS Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.\r\n\r\nThe cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences - even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over £180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode \"Steel\", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7/10\r\n\r\nHome format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production.",

They live together in the headquarters, or Riley's head, and they look after Riley's memories.\r\n\r\nAfter eleven years of enjoyment and content, Riley and her parents are forced to move out of Minnesota, away from her friends and hockey team, and moves to the city of San Francisco inside a desolate and cold house.\r\n\r\nBut things get even more anarchic when Joy and Sadness are sundered away from the rest of the gang, holding onto Riley's core memories that make Riley, well, Riley. One by one, the islands of personality fall apart as the rest of the gang back in headquarters watch in dismay and anguish. After all, Joy is not there to keep things under control.\r\n\r\nInside Out truly contemplates the hardships of growing up, but every problem comes to a heart-wrenching solution. The movie truly captivates this and continues the Pixar tradition of inspiration, family, and friendship in a little bit under two hours. Watch this, you must.",

There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.\r\n\r\nIt held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren’t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. \r\n\r\nAnother difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.\r\n\r\nAn improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.\r\n\r\nSo ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.",

Not so much of the Marvel wit and humor that are more like to hold me, the anything but average fan, or rather,not a fan at all, though I do like science fiction.\r\n\r\nFor me, the 500 pound elephant in the room that cast a shadow over the entire movie was the villain. Now if you haven’t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn’t want to adopt. \r\n\r\nIt seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them. Yeah, do as I say, kids, not as I do. \r\n\r\nWhoever created the evil dark book that took over her personality would have been disappointed that it was used merely to seed a new family.",

But I think they are both classic westerns. He seems to bring out the best in his cinematographer, both for scenery and for his characters.\r\n\r\nIn one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn’t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique.\r\n\r\nOn a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra. Check it out.\r\n\r\nSo the movie works for me on multiple levels, and I own a copy so I can watch it any time the mood strikes me",

I am sure there are complex reasons applicable to me. I read them when I was very young and it would be difficult to match that first-time experience. Also, the fighting and battles seem more central to the story than I remember. Perhaps that relates more to the modern movie audience rather than my memory.\r\n\r\nAs a funny side note, the film seemed to resemble in places that other fantasy series: the Jurassic Park franchise, in that they seemed to always be going from one close call to another, and the Wizard or somebody repeatedly yelled, “Run!” This series certainly sends the message that if you ever go on a dangerous adventure, it helps to have a wizard along for the journey.",

This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.\r\n\r\nThese movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik’s coffee making machinery.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a–holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\r\n\r\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik’s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I’m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.\r\n\r\nBottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.",

Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.\r\n\r\nI’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though.

Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a “young adult” movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:",

I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien’s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.\n\nStill, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.\n\nThe story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.\n\nI have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nOn the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a “Tolkienesque” athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",

                "review": "I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.\r\n\r\nI remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where’s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.\r\n\r\nHowever, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there’s only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.\r\n\r\nIn the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.\r\n\r\nSo,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.\r\n\r\nI hadn’t actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:\r\n\r\nCritics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films — and one of the most controversial — Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity — and folly — of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt’s pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called “critics” are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there’s really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap “the folly”. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future  than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.\r\n\r\nSure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably “interpret” the hell out of any movie and “find” whatever message you want but it is still bullshit.\r\n\r\nWell, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.",

Slapstick at best and mostly just annoying. Certainly not very funny a lot of the time. Sure occasionally I did laugh but that was about one out of three times.\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started about Quill. He’s a stupid, unfunny jerk. He so drags down these movies.\r\n\r\nThe movie does deliver when it comes to one very important aspect of superhero movies though and this is of course the action and special effects. I really liked them and most of my enjoyment of this movie came from this.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually quite okay though and it was kind of cool to get the story about Rocket.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy, well, he is really one of the best parts of this movie. Finally they managed to put together a real bonafide, megalomaniac, psychopathic and genocidal bad guy with lots of (bad) charisma.\r\n\r\nEven if he, despite being a genius in creating all kinds of biological creations, including new species, could not fix his own face instead of wearing a silly latex mask. Seriously? That just the usual dumbass Hollywood script writing.\r\n\r\nOverall though, this was a fun, special effects loaded, action roller coaster and, surprisingly enough when it comes to Marvel, not loaded with woke preaching.\r\n\r\nAnd it was cool to see Sylvester Stallone again even if it was just briefly.\r\n\r\nIf they had toned down the silliness, or gotten someone intelligent to write the jokes, it would have gotten another star from me.",

                "review": "This is a good and very enjoyable movie which, to me, was a bit surprising since I generally find that time travel is akin to sticking your foot in some messy and smelly stuff. It almost always screws up the movie in some way or another. This one was not without its faults but it did survive becoming too screwed up by it.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes are indeed somewhat impressive throwing the viewer directly into an apocalyptic future where mutants as well as human are rounded up by sentinels. I could not help but think about Terminator during these scenes. Maybe not very original from a general point of view but the dark and gloomy opening was not the opening scenes I would have expected from an X-Men movie.\r\n\r\nThen we, unfortunately, dive straight into some time travel when they send Wolverine back to 1973. This is of course a opportunity to make yet another twist of the mutant scare, mutants hunt, a good mutant is a dead mutant etc. story that we have seen in so many movies now. The main adversary changes but the general story idea stays the same and the arguments for hunting down the mutants are as silly as ever. Quite frankly, I find that angle a wee bit overdone and boring by now.\r\n\r\nLuckily the story is fairly well implemented. The scene were Wolverine wakes up and disposes of the three thugs are rather funny. Pretty standard stuff but pretty funny nevertheless. The part where they retrieve Magneto is quite nice and the scene down in the Pentagon where the guards and everything else is “frozen” while Maximoff calmly walks around and rearranges things is outright hilarious.\r\n\r\nI quite disliked the cheap twist where Magneto just decided to go amok and screw things up just when they were about to retrieve Mystique though. They could have spent some time coming up with a better way to twist the story at that time. The idiotic stuff with Wolverine getting a fit at the same time was just adding to my annoyance with that scene. This part is the main reason I will not give this movie a top score.\r\n\r\nApart from this scene the movie is a very well done superhero movie with lots of nice special effects. Sure it is also rather predictable but most people, including myself, do watch these movies mostly for the effects after all. As long as the plot is not downright stupid it get to pass.\r\n\r\nTime travel. Okay, I have to harp a bit about time travel. I do not like it in movies because there are too many things that just does not add up. In this movie it is not too bad and most of the time the actual time travel aspect is kept out of the action. Wolverine goes back in time, does his stuff with a lot of action, and saves the day. Sure the dialog often comes back to the “I’m from the future” aspect but not much more. One thing annoys the hell out me though. Wolverine affects a lot of events while he is back there but not a single things seems to change in the future until one single event passes at the end of the movie. Then everything changes and it is happy ending. That is the kind of nonsense that time travel in movies ends up with.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that this is a very enjoyable movie. Without the rubbish plot twist in the middle it would have gotten 9 or 10 stars.",

I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.\n\nI can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.\n\nThe movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the “heroes” are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where “Wardaddy” forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I’ll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.\n\nHaving said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.\n\nThe pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.\n\nThe “last stand” at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our “heroes” have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f… did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.\n\nThe ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed.",

However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another “standard” comic book villain a’ la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies.

The movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured (for a movie in this genre) and well done.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a red thread, started by McCall’s first act of vigilantism, running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie. I like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie.\r\n\r\nThe main thread pitches McCall against a real psychopathic Russian enforcer. No one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy. The role is quite well played. The guy is creepy to say the least. Not to mention violent of course but then so is McCall when the time is right.\r\n\r\nOne thing I liked with this movie is that McCall it is not one of the usual run around, look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes. McCall is always calm, calculating, behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late.\r\n\r\nSure, the capacity of McCall to clobber the bad guys, usually without getting hurt himself, is bordering on superhuman but what the heck, it is fiction after all. Totally realistic movies are rarely fun, at least not movies of this genre. Also, the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better. Especially since the Russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point. Having said that, I did like that it did not degenerate into the usual 20 minute shoot anything that moves nonsense. McCall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found this to be a rather entertaining movie. In one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff, which I happen to like, but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to Denzel Washington’s cold, calculating and intelligent portrayal of McCall.",

Personally, I think this movie is rather mediocre.\r\n\r\nCinematically it is not a bad movie. I liked the footage for the most part. Story wise, well, for the first half of the movie I found it rather boring actually.\r\n\r\nThere was some brief scenes with a wolf and later a bear that had some action in it but for the most part the main protagonist ran around moping and whining and trying to pretend to be worthy of being a great warrior. Somewhat unrealistic of course since Hollywood, of course, had cast a woman in the role. Not that I have anything against it per see but at the time this movie is supposed to happen a women, native Indian or not, stayed at home doing the chores whether Hollywood tries to pretend otherwise or not.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I m still okay with that but she spends most of the time fumbling, stumbling and when a threat comes around she runs and looks scared. Not the kind of great warrior charisma that I was hoping for in the main protagonist.\r\n\r\nWhen it finally starts to get interesting she stumbles into a bloody animal trap and gets caught by a hunting party. The latter which of course is portrayed as the typical Hollywood stereotype of “white man bad”. Minor details like, having your foot caught in that kind of steel trap would render you useless for the rest of the movie, is of course ignored.\r\n\r\nThe later half of the movie has some action in it at least which is dragged down by the main protagonists moping and the fact that, when she finally has the chance of taking a shot, she just stares stupidly for half a minute and voila, the chance is gone.\r\n\r\nOn the good side is that the actors are doing a pretty decent job of the not so great script they were given and, as I mentioned, cinematically it is a quite good movie. The action, when it happens, is pretty good if one ignores the Hollywood stupidities and the not so kick-behind main protagonist.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie is watchable and, as I wrote, better than previous instalments in the franchise but that is about it.",

You would have thought that with such a budget they could have hired some guy to make a basic sanity check of the script but obviously that wasn’t in the budget for this one. I do not know if a lot of Hollywood people are idiots or think the audience are idiots or both but for Christ sake, how difficult can it be to come up with a plot that holds together and are at least half believable?\r\n\r\nA trillion dollar expedition to discover the “makers of mankind” and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from Earth.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone behaves in a completely unbelievable way. Yeah, it looks okay so let’s remove the helmets for instance? Right, apart from the immediate danger to your own health, what about quarantine procedures…idiots?\r\n\r\nWhy did the robot put the mutagen in the drink? It’s just illogical and never really adequately explained. Speaking of robots, robots have a power source and it’s not spread all over them. If you rip their head of they do not continue to talk like nothing had happened. In the original Alien they at least had to hook him up to something. It goes on. The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. \r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. What a joke. Apart from the fact that Elizabeth’s actions are just ridiculous, how does she expect to live on a alien ship without food or any other supplies?\r\n\r\nThis film had good promise. The idea of getting to know the origin of the aliens intrigued me and the basic plot idea was cool. However, the film was really ruined by a script obviously written by total morons.",

I found the movie to be quite enjoyable but at the same time a bit of a let-down.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it is better than the previous trilogy by Sam Raimi (well it is not very hard to make something that is better than the 2nd installment in that trilogy of course). The film is darker, more serious and Spider Man is not so silly and a total mess-up when out of his costume as the character portrayed by Toby Maquire.\r\n\r\nHowever, this movie has its own faults which makes me have to think hard whether it is really that much of an improvement over the previous movie and this is what makes me feel a bit let-down since I had hope that this reboot would be that “real” Spider Man movie that enabled me to forget about the previous ones.\r\n\r\nA lot of not so interesting scenes are really dragged out and the important stuff is rushed. Peter Parker’s transition to Spider Man after his bitten is over and done with quite quickly. In another scene he spends 5 minutes trying to talk some kid out of a car. He even takes off his mask and gives it to him (what the f…) and in the end just zips him out with a net shot. He could have done that right away and spared us the boring time.\r\n\r\nGenerally I think this movie is indeed a better Spider Man movie than the previous ones though and I quite enjoyed the movie evening yesterday, just not as much as I hoped.",

Last night it was Venom’s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as “critics” claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that’s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.\r\n\r\nThe good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.\r\n\r\nI guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he’s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It’s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a “thing” and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.\r\n\r\nIt’s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.\r\n\r\nIf the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is “just” good.",

It is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nThe movie is childish. There is no other way to describe it. My memory of spider man is a quite serious young man with a sharp and witty tongue. Not the fumbling and childish Spider Man in this movie. His best friend may be a good computer geek but otherwise he is dumb as a door nail and just tiring to watch. His, supposedly adult handler is a screw up who, surprise surprise, is hanging up the phone because he cannot be bothered to listen to kids.\r\n\r\nThe FX may be good as FX goes visually but it was also the typical, nonsensical Hollywood rubbish like boats that stays afloat forever despite being split in half etc. etc. The talking Spider Man suit appears to be programmed by the same guy who wrote the childish script.\r\n\r\nThe main bad guy pretty much has zero charisma and is nothing but a simple thief. Same goes for his buddies.\r\n\r\nThe SJW crap spread out here and there in the movie, especially in the Washington Monument scenes, was unwanted and just pissed me off.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that this movie missed its mark for me by a wide margin. I do not understand why it seems to be so bloody difficult for Hollywood to make a good Spider Man movie. I like Spider Man, the comics character that is, so I find the slew of substandard movies really disappointing.\r\n\r\nThe only reason it doesn't get less than two out of three stars from me is because, as a kids movie, it is not at all bad (except for the SJW crap).

Especially if one can expect a decent amount of special effects and gore so…\r\n\r\nIt is not a great movie. Not even a good movie really but it is a half decent B-movie horror flick. It sure as hell is better than that woke piece of trash that Netflix has produced with their TV-show adaptation of the franchise but then that does not really say very much.\r\n\r\nThe story is rather non-existent and things just happen for no good reason. It is like the writer just took a bunch of zombie and monster encounters and threw them in a mixer to see what came out. Sure there is a resemblance of a background story there but it is not much.\r\n\r\nWe never get to know why the zombies escaped into Raccoon City, why the experiments where abandoned or anything else that might enlighten us as to why zombies pop up here and there all the time (apart from the fact that it is a Resident Evil movie and it is Raccoon City of course). There also seems to be a number of characters in the movie that knows a lot about what is actually going on but again, we never really get much of an explanation. I have understood that the movie is based on the story in the first three of the games so I guess those that have played them might understand the why’s better.\r\n\r\nThe main reason to watch this movie is the special effects, the gore and the action and this is best done with your brain in the off position. There are indeed some decent gory special effects and I have to say that the monsters in the later half of the movie was pretty okay.\r\n\r\nI do miss Milla Jovovich though. There is not really any good kick-ass replacement for her although some of the characters tried. Also, for f… sake, will the dumbass Hollywood script writers ever going to stop putting stupid shit in the movies, like firing off bazookas and rocket launcher in confined spaces, say a train car. It doesn’t work unless the goal is to also kill the person firing it you morons!\r\n\r\nOne thing that annoyed me throughout the entire movie though is the fact that it is really dark. Sure it is a horror movie so some dark scenes is to be expected but the entire movie is really really dark. To the extent that it really is difficult to see what is going on for a lot of the movie. It might have worked in a cinema but on a TV-screen, even with the pretty good OLED that I have, it is really too dark.\r\n\r\nSo it was pretty much what I expected, a basic B-movie of the gore feast variety.

                "review": "I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke “critics” on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.\r\n\r\nIt begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThis movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.\r\n\r\nThe story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.\r\n\r\nOverall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn’t fall in the trap of trying to “educate” said audience.",

I’m not sure what the script writers was up to when writing it but they really seem to have a very low opinion of the audience’s intelligence. Either that or it was written for a very young audience.\r\n\r\nThere were parts of the movie that was quite fun to watch but on the whole it was pretty much a mess. It is a shame because it had quite a bit of promise. The core of the plot was not too bad although I really wish that Hollywood writers would stay away from plots involving computer gadgetry. Their knowledge in that area simply stinks. Thus the gadget that the entire movie was spun around was simply stupid.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately another core plot element was the crooked CIA (or whatever department it was supposed to be) boss that of course had to do some senseless backstabbing just to prolong the movie. Tiresome, overused and boring. I know, I know with fucktards like Comey I guess one could say that it would not be too far from the truth but it is still tiresome, overused and boring.\r\n\r\nSince I am on a rant anyway let’s go on to the various stunts and special effects. It is a long time since I watched a movie where the stunts were so obviously and totally overdone and unrealistic. I mean, they were unrealistic to the point where I started to wander if it was a slapstick comedy I was watching.\r\n\r\nAll of this really dragged down the movie … a lot!\r\n\r\nOn the good side. I did like many of the wacky characters. It is a shame that many of their wacky moments were less of a comic relief due to the above mentioned silliness but instead felt like the more serious moments in the movie.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel, well I watched this movie because I am a Vin Diesel fan so of course I liked him. He is his usual badass and kick ass self. He is also surrounded by a bunch of badass (and wacky as I mentioned before) characters. I quite liked the ensemble. The guy who seems to collect crashes is rather silly but fun in a strange way. I did like the gun girl a lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, apart from quite a few fun and/or cool scenes the movie as a whole did not cut it. In my opinion it was ruined by a substandard script devoid of any form of intelligence. I would go as far as to say that the writers were incompetent pure and simple. I was almost giving it three stars because there was many parts I liked but in the end … no, there is no way I could justify more than two stars for this mess.\r\n\r\nReally a shame. I would have liked to see more xXx movies but after this one I’m not sure anyone will bet money on that.",

The plot, although thin, is not altogether bad, it holds together even though are quite a few unbelievable moments. However, put in the context of a traditional disaster movie, it is not bad.. Maybe this is what I like about the movie. It is really a good old fashioned disaster movie.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read the blurb about this movie I was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a “slow” search for Ray’s daughter. It is nothing of the kind. It has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes … and then it continues. I was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but I was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. The special effects are not however. At least, I liked them. Not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. I also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when Ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. I found that quite cool. There are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. For instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. The we have when Ray and his wife speeds through the waters of Los Angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. The amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. But then, I think I am too much of an engineer now.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ray’s wife. That was one of the things I really did not like with the movie. Maybe the movie directors and actors in Hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a “standard” plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other “ordinary” people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the US apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from Hollywood all the time) and I really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and TV-shows! I was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and I do like “The Rock”.\r\n\r\nSo after, after that little outburst, I have to say that I this one was a really enjoyable movie. One of the few lately that I have watched. It is a quite good, classical, disaster movie with a good build up, really good effects and a good and happy ending (for the main characters at last) and I am a sucker for happy endings.",

This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.\r\n\r\nThis one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhen something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.\r\n\r\nHow the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.\r\n\r\nThere is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is where I consider the movie to have ended. After that it was only boring filler scenes remaining.",

After all, the one with David Suchet was perfect.\r\n\r\nI guess I was right to be hesitant. This is another one of those remakes where you just wonder…why? As a movie it is not too bad but as a Hercule Poirot movie, the classical Murder on the Orient Express no less, it is like buying a piece of prime filet of beef and discovering that the butcher gave you chicken drums when you open the package. Edible but not at all what you paid for.\r\n\r\nTo me this movie was a blatant attempt to make an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. It was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of by introducing Hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. Apart from the scene more or less making Hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? Oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.\r\n\r\nThen there are some things that Hercule simply do not do. Like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. He even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for Christ sake!\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! As I said, an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. Unfortunately bigger is not always better.\r\n\r\nI can go on for some time here so let’s move on.\r\n\r\nTechnically the movie is not that bad. The scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. Unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved Hercule Poirot character.\r\n\r\nPart of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on Hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like … props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. One reviewer wrote that “The actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Branagh act.” and there seems to be some truth in that.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends with a hint of further moves. Personally, I hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended).",

Luke is no longer a young farm boy running around saving the universe. The Star Wars universe and its characters are evolving and that is the way it should be and the way it is. Time for the next generation to pick up the torch.\nBoth me and my son really liked this movie.

Not only does this one not feel like it is reusing old material (too much) but it also feels like it is opening a new chapter in the Star Wars universe.\nThe FX is as good as you have the right to expect from a Star Wars movie. The story is fresh and well developed. It will not win any Oscars of course but I liked it. It makes things evolve while at the same time giving enough room for action and a wee bit of humor.\n\nThe characters are almost all good and well played. I am looking forward to seeing more of most of them, especially, Rey and Poe. I’m not 100% convinced about Finn and Rose but I can live with them.  Kylo Ren do not yet fill up the shoes of Darth Vader but he is showing promise. Contrary to Snoke I do feel he should put on a mask though.\n\nThe two characters I did not really like was General Hux and DJ. The first one was just incompetent. I’m not sure if he was supposed to be a bit of comical relief or not but, as far as I am concerned, we can do without him. DJ, well I guess he was supposed to not be liked so he did a good job of that but these kinds of assholes just frustrate me to no end. We never saw him actually meet his demise in this movie so if he is brought back I hope it will be for the sole purpose of rectifying that oversight…as violently and painfully as possible.\n\nOf course, we saw a few new ships as well and as usual with the Empire bigger is better…or maybe not. Not sure what to say about these new designs. At least they did not look like a enlarged (except for the bridge) Star Destroyer like Darth Vader’s Super Star Destroyer.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me in the first battle though was the rebels’ so called “bombers”. What kind of bloody moron designed those? They were just so wrong in so many ways. The design itself was just silly looking. They were slower than a flee on a patch of tar. Seriously, a space bomber that crawls along? Actually, why make a “bomber” in space at all? That brings us to the biggest gripe of them all with this ludicrous design…dropping bombs vertically? In space? How the fuck do they fall?\n\nSure they looked somewhat cool when they dropped their bombs…if your knowledge of physics is on the level of your average politician (and obviously a few Hollywood employees as well).\n\nAnyway, on the whole me and my son had two and a half hours of great fun watching The Last Jedi. I hope the next movie expands on the threads this one started. I have to say that I was a bit sorry about the feeble state of the resistance at the end, so I do hope the next writer will not let this drag on. One way to ruin Star Wars for me would be to turn Star Wars into some Battlestar Galactica variant with resistance survivors on constant run from the empire. Now it is time for the resistance to strike back, and for Rey to evolve her Jedi powers.",

                "review": "X-Men Apocalypse is typical of what you would expect from a Marvel X-Men movie. Light on story and depth and heavy on special effects and action. In short it is exactly what I, as a Science Fiction and Fantasy geek, would expect as well as hope for.\r\n\r\nThe X-Men faces a new threat in the form of the worlds first mutant. Naturally said mutant is really a Übermutant vastly more powerful than any “normal” mutant. Equally naturally this Übermutant is set on a path of world destruction and domination. I quite liked this villain. He is a good all evil and powerful bad guy and a worthy adversary. No nonsense about trying to make the villain likable or trying to explain why he turned evil or such like. This guy is evil, he is the bad guy, he needs to be taken down…full stop.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote the story is not the most elaborate one around but it is a good one within the confines of a Marvel super hero movie. It gets the job done without being overly stupid or silly. It is set in the “prequel” universe created by X-Men First Class. The movie adds a few new X-Men to the ranks of Professor Xaviers team. Some of them thanks to the manipulations of Apocalypse although they start out on the bad side at first.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves along at a decent enough pace and, as was mentioned, there are quite a few action sequences and special effects thrown at the viewer throughout the movie. Personally I found the special effects to be quite good. Even stunning at times. I am quite a bit of a special effects nerd so of course this pleased me a lot.\r\n\r\nThe movies ending certainly opens the door to future X-Men movies and I for sure would like to see the franchise continue. I very much enjoyed these almost two and a half hours in front of my TV set.",

You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so… Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.\r\n\r\nThe movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.",

It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.\r\n\r\nGary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.\r\n\r\nGary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallell. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.\r\n\r\nThe movie has all the “goodies” of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent “stuff” like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind’s nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so than the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.\r\n\r\nAll things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned.",

                "review": "I have to say that this was a rather “meh” experience. It certainly was not an improvement over the original. Why try to rewrite a story that was actually not bad when you cannot be bothered to spend some effort on it? The new story is sloppy and it is rather clear that whoever wrote it got only two directives: Make sure that Megan Fox gets a lot of focus and if you do not know what to write then cram in some special effects. There are a lot of special effects in this movie!\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Megan Fox’s ego have had a lot of influence on the movie. To the extent that you might wonder if this movie is about the turtles or about Megan Fox. She might be the wet dream of some less discerning teenagers but her acting skills leaves somewhat to be desired. Okay, okay she was actually not too bad in this movie but then it was not to difficult to shine in this movie either.\r\n\r\nThere are a few moments when it looks like it is going to turn interesting. For instance when the shredder is first introduced and punishes some of his underlings but rather quickly he is reduced to just another “special effect” when they slap this robotic shredder suit onto him. Come on, he is supposed to be a skilled martial arts combatant, not some freak in a robotic suit.\r\n\r\nSplinter was just sad. Some lab rat that picked up martial arts from a book he found in the sewers! What the f…? That ruined a lot of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe turtles themselves, being already pushed back somewhat into the background by Megan Fox desire to be in front of the cameras most of the time, are bland to say the least. They are immature, even for a movie like this, and the jokes are simply unintelligent and mostly not very funny.\r\n\r\nI was about to write that, if you like special effects and do not care for much of the rest, then you will probably like this movie but when I think back even the special effects where often only mildly interesting. They were perhaps not really bad but not very impressive either. The truck ride down a snowy slope was just silly and some of the scenes where actually rather underwhelming for instance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, to me, this was a mildly entertaining movie that could have been much better if someone with basic intelligence had been asked to write the script in the first place. There are actually five (!) people credited with writing this movie and maybe that is the problem. Too many cooks!",

Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less…well…stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.",

                "review": "This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.\r\n\r\nThis movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.\r\n\r\nThe gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike “Mr Nobody” but I have to say that I quite liked him.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not?\r\n\r\nWell, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer.",

                "review": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario. The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say “that is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.” The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.\r\n\r\nI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.\r\n\r\nScore: 72%\r\nVerdict: Good",

Despite its minor drawbacks, it does enough to intrigue the viewer and kept me engaged.\r\n\r\nThe performances are a little off, which is expected as this film is primarily carried by three twelve-year-olds. But they get better as the film progresses and the adults in the film are able to bring the average up with their amazing performances.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie suffers from being dated with poor effects, CGI, and some rough child acting. Never-the-less, it manages to create an experience like no other and I expect the films to do nothing but improve from the initial entry.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _77%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

                "review": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish had a lot to live up to as most of my critic and casual friends have been praising the film, and for the most part the film delivers.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening frames, the unique art style fills the screen and is incredibly captivating. There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\r\n\r\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\r\n\r\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!\r\n\r\nScore: 86%\r\nVerdict: Great",

                "review": "_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a worthy sequel that improves upon the first and expands the lore in a grand way.\r\n\r\nThe quality in this film is vastly superior to the first in terms of CGI and acting, which is par for the course as the main trio grows into their roles and as actors. It is evident that the CGI team had adequate time before this film's release because for 2002 the effects are spectacular. From Dobby the Elf to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, this movie nails creature models and creates very believable interactions between the models and the actors.\r\n\r\nDespite this film not having the impact in terms of discovering the magical world of Hogwarts for the first time, the story is able to improve upon its predecessor delivering an all-around stronger plot. There is a real sense of mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets and the suspense and hysteria it creates around Hogwarts is very intriguing. The stakes and the plot progression feel elevated here, creating a more seamless experience.\r\n\r\nLike previously stated, the main casts acting is improved drastically. Each actor is coming into their own and really is getting comfortable with their character. Rupert Grint steals the show with his comedic timing and cowardly presence. Emma Watson is great again but does not carry the entire trio like she had to in the previous film. There are plenty of new additions this time around and all of them were splendid. I particularly liked Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and that is all you can ask for a sequel.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _79%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here.\r\n\r\nBefore I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch.\r\n\r\nBack to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton.\r\n\r\nThis film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\nScore: 96% |\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece\r\n\r\nOn a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.\r\n\r\nThe quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fiancé and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.\r\n\r\nThe trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling \"villains\" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _87%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

                "review": "_Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ is an absolute spectacle. I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.\r\n\r\nOur main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.\r\n\r\nThere is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _89%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

                "review": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is another solid entry into the series with fantastically high stakes, production value, and emotional scenes that leave a lasting impact.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning minutes, the movie is doubling down on the dark tone the previous two began to establish. The threat of Voldemort still looms, but it is incredibly frustrating that no one seems to believe Harry and Dumbledore. That frustration is perfectly mirrored with Harry as he grows incredibly angry throughout the film, paralleling his connection with the Dark Lord. This more mature and seasoned Potter is a highlight, and his leadership begins to take center stage as he organizes his classmates to train to fight against the dark arts. These scenes are some of my favorites in the film.\r\n\r\nThis entry expands on the wizarding world with the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix. The Ministry of Magic is terrible in this film, they are completely mad and delusional to accept any other explanation for the events that have taken place in the previous entries. This is none more present than the introduction of Mrs. Umbridge. She is the worst, and Imelda Staunton does an excellent job of being the worst. I hated her throughout the entire film and every one of her sly smiles was like nails on a chalkboard. Safe to say her finale was oh-so-satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe ending is slightly rushed, but the action is fantastic. It was a bit unbelievable that a group of students could face the Death Eaters by themselves, but the movie addressed the criticism when the Order came to save the day. I do have to say, the death scene of Sirius Black was pretty anti-climactic. The hit he takes happens so fast and he gingerly falls back into the portal never to be seen again, it did not have the resolution I would have hoped for with him being such an influential person in Harry's life. Plus, his limited screen time in the series draws back the effectiveness of his death. Despite that, the special effects in the Dumbledore and Voldemort battle were spectacular and unique, a brilliant way to cap off the film. Especially with the ending shot of Cornelius Fudge just realizing \"He's Back\"\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a slow movie with a limited amount of action. But the world-building and character development are some of the best in the series. It is not going to be everyone's favorite, but it was a great addition, even though the rewatchability is not that high.\r\n\r\nScore: 85% | \r\nVerdict Great",

                "review": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince may be the most mature film of the franchise with fantastic character development, but at the cost of action and a somewhat slow pace.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the film suffers from what a lot of these films do where the audience is taken from location to location, without any explanation as to why. It is difficult to follow at times, but it's a sacrifice that unfortunately has to be made when adapting a long novel into a feature-length film. Despite this film being the slowest of the series, it does a tremendous amount of leg work setting up the epic conclusion. From the introduction of the Horcruxes to the multiple scenes of Voldemort's past, the audience gets a ton of background information revealing details from the previous film that creates a more coherent story structure.\r\n\r\nHalf-Blood Prince has a more focused return to Hogwarts and the class aspect which I enjoyed. Jim Broadbent's Professor Horace was a great addition and his connection with Potter is so seamless, with some aid from the Half-Blood Prince's textbook. Not only does Harry have great chemistry with Professor Horace, but his relationship with Dumbledore blossoms, and his reverence for the headmaster is captivating. It was great to see these two finally working together and trusting each other. Previously Harry would always hold information or Dumbledore would tell Harry to never mind, but finally, they get on the same page, and it was great to see.\r\n\r\nThis connection aids tremendously in the final scenes of the film. The trials that these two characters are put through are immense, but Harry's trust in Dumbledore is shown in a very uncomfortable scene of Dumbledore forcing down a poison of some sort. This struggle crescendos into an incredibly impactful finale with Dumbledore, unfortunately, dying at the hands of Snape. There were some fantastic character moments between Snape and Malfoy, and the light inside both of them is hinted at in this final scene. Dumbledore's death is felt, not only by the students of Hogwarts but by the audience as well. This is one of the more effective deaths in the series due to the audience's time with the character, as opposed to the death of Sirius Black in the previous film.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is slow and can drag on a bit. But there are some great character moments and plot developments that make this a fantastic beginning of the end for the series.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%\r\nVerdict Great",

There are so many side plots and new characters being introduced that the film has a hard time finding its footing. For as much as I enjoyed Riri Williams and here banter with Wakadans, her arch was not necessary. By omitting this character, the story could have been more focused and streamlined creating an easier viewing experience and deflating the runtime.\r\nThe writing was decent, but it was pretty exposition heavy. There were countless number of lines that were strictly feeding information to the audience, and they felt inorganic and awkward in the moment. These writing mishaps really hurt my enjoyment and constantly pulled me out of the film.\r\n\r\nAfter those main criticisms, I think this movie overall does a great job in all other departments. The action is surprisingly light, but when it does come it is intense and well-choreographed. There are some really unique fight sequences and weapons introduced with the \"Atlanteans\" that allowed for some really cool scenes and visuals that were done with some stellar CGI. I specifically like how the final battle had some letterboxing that was not present in the rest of the film. It gave it a grand scale that I thought was excellent touch.\r\n\r\nThe performances were fantastic all around. Angela Bassett was mesmerizing and really captivated me with her emotion and distress with the passing of her son. There is a scene in here that gave me literal goosebumps. Dominique Thorne was a great addition as Iron-Heart and Lupita Nyong'o was amazing in her limited screen time. I loved Winston Duke and desperately wanted more screentime from him. He was sidelined for the majority of the film, and I think that was the wrong decision. Letitia Wright is the real highlight here. She stepped into a very difficult situation and acted her ass off. I never envisioned her as a lead actress, but she proved me wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething I want to note that I do not normally include in my reviews in the music choice. The score to this movie was crafted brilliantly and really elevate so many scenes. I enjoyed every song and feel as though it blended with the movie brilliantly.\r\nOverall, this movie has its drawbacks but is still an enjoyable watch and one of the better movies in Marvel Phase IV.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _75%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Good_",

The entire first act feels so disjointed and rushed. You get thrown plot point after plot point and get whipped from planet to planet which results in the viewer not being able to lock in on the story. I really enjoyed the scenes we got from Gorr and Jane during this act, but they felt a little underdeveloped and rushed. The comedy was a little thick during this section, some jokes completely missed, but it was nothing that was overbearing that it hurt the experience. Once the movie enters the second act and begins focusing on Jane the entire gets much better. It is here where you can really see the balance that Taika Waititi brought during Ragnarök with some moments rivaling the best from that film. The ending of this film has some really great action and cinematography, some may argue it's among the best in the MCU. As the movie credits rolled, I was very satisfied to the conclusion of this film and am ready for more Thor action in the future.\r\nThe acting all around was excellent in this film, I found the dynamic between Jane and Thor worked much better than in previous films. They had real chemistry on screen, and you could feel the love the two previously shared unearth with each additional scene. There are some really great conversations that dive into their relationship that were done fantastically. Christian Bale was menacing as Gorr, his demeanor was sinister and completely unhinged as he delivered crazy laughs while delivering his villain manifesto. It gave me serious flashbacks to Heath Ledger’s Joker. I just wish we got to see more of him in the film, but the bit we did see was top tier villainy in the MCU.\r\nThe music in this film blends with the scenes very well. When the Guns N' Roses guitar starts playing you know it is about to go down and I could not help but smile. While the beginning of this film was bad, I can admit, the ending was so great that it averaged out the movie and made it a very enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_\r\n\r\n**Score:** _7/10_",

Fury of the Gods is a run-of-the mill superhero sequel that doesn’t progress the genre forward, but delivers two hours of pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis film does not do any one thing great, but it was still a pretty decent watch. The plot is average—nothing we have not seen on the big screen before. Our villains have no development; their motivations are sound, but there is nothing further that develops them into something greater.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts off incredibly strong, with a fantastic first act that had me laughing hysterically. The comedy hits more often than not, which was a surprise for me. There is a bridge rescue scene that is electric. The combination of \"I Need a Hero\" mixed with all of the heroes showcasing their abilities was amazing. I think superhero films have dropped the ball by not showing heroes rescuing everyday people. The stakes have gotten so high outside of the everyday troubles that this art is lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film, but unfortunately, after the first act, this story becomes inflated to a point where it is indistinguishable from many other superhero blockbusters.\r\n\r\nThe final act is overly long and bloated with a plethora of CGI monsters for our heroes to defeat. I think the CGI actually looked pretty good, but it just was not an engaging conclusion for me. The stakes were high, but not built up properly for me to be genuinely interested. The action is pretty decent, but I couldn’t care less. The finale did have emotional beats in terms of the family connection, which worked surprisingly well. That is when this franchise works best. When the focus is on family and not on god's attempts to destroy Earth,\r\n\r\nThe performances overall were pretty good. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam; he has mastered the art of playing a child in a man's body. Jack Dylan Grazer is hilarious; his comedic timing is brilliant. Grace Caroline Currey is a queen. Rachel Zegler is a standout, and her chemistry with Grazer is top notch. The rest of the Shazamly do a great job as well. I think Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are fine as antagonists but were wasted with a lack of screen time and development.\r\n\r\nOverall, this might not be good, but it is entertaining.

The first hour flew by with fantastic build-up and character development. The action was superb and brutally realistic, showcasing the true horrors of the War in Afghanistan in a respectable way. However, after this first act, the movie does slow down a bit, with a pretty substantial lull that lasted about 20 minutes in the middle of the film. It was not terrible, but something I definitely noticed. Performances were excellent, particularly from Dar Salim, who was a standout in the film. His grueling journey across the Afghanistan terrain was one of the most stressful and inspiring segments in any film so far this year and had me at the edge of my seat.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Covenant is a pretty straightforward war story, told with excellent direction, performances, and visuals.

The first half was pretty messy, with a lot of new characters introduced and events taking place across multiple different locations. The New York setting created a multitude of interesting set pieces, but the spanning locations result in the movie being slightly unfocused at times. The film rushed through this introduction, which resulted in poor pacing. The second half was an intense, paranoia-inducing sequence that had me on the edge of my seat. As a whole, the movie worked well but could have been much better.\r\n\r\nThe best parts about Scream VI are the characters and the action. All of our returning cast is fantastic, and their chemistry works so well together. They are so great on screen that I feel as though the film does not really need the legacy characters, as they seem somewhat unnecessary. Our new cast members do fine in their roles, but they are not nearly as interesting as our core four. But that is fine in a slasher, as their role is to be carved up by Ghostface. This film is especially brutal, with some particularly gruesome kills and fantastic effects work to show the remains of our victims. There are a few kills that were top-notch and will go down as some of my favorites in the franchise. Scream VI is the first film for me that genuinely had me stressed. There are a few scenes that just linger for a moment too long and create an unsettling feeling in me that I thought worked really well. My favorite scene was the subway sequence, as my heart was pounding for genuinely two minutes straight.\r\n\r\nOther than the rushed first act, my only complaint has to do with the ending and some of the unbelievability in terms of our cast's survival. Although I do not think the final reveal was as bad as most reviewers make it out to be, I still think it could have been slightly better. I had one killer pegged from the beginning, but the other was a surprise, so I think they did a good job keeping the audience in the dark. Our characters take quite the beating in this film, with some being stabbed nearly a dozen times and still somehow being able to survive. It isn’t a huge deal, but it did take me out of the film a bit. Also, I spent nearly ten minutes of the movie trying to figure out how the hell Kirby was alive; I could have sworn she died in Scream 4.\r\n\r\nOverall, Scream VI was a welcomed addition to the franchise, even if it was not as good as Scream (2022). I do think my expectations were a bit high from the initial reactions, which may have led me to being slightly let down.\r\n\r\nScore: 68%\r\nVerdict: Good",

How I wish more people would only appreciate how **( -Incredibly- )** difficult it is to emote for two -very- different entities, -near- simultaneously, that exist within just -{ ONE SINGLE }- body. 3 : Venom's \"Mardi-Gras Themed Nightclub Scene\". Simply stated, it's just absofreakinglutely -{ H I 💥 😂 - larious }. What's more, if you're a -passionate- progressive ( in real life ), like me, then you are almost -certain- to completely -{ Adore }- the 'horrible yet affable' Antihero's -equally- passionate appeal to stop \"Cruelty Against **ALIENS**\" . . . just a 'Glorious', ( albeit somewhat implicit ) message about the need to be -'Kinder'- to immigrants, documented or otherwise, delivered just -as- 'Gloriously' . . . ( Need I really say more ? ). \r\n\r\n**B \" ( _PLEASE_ ) , Let There Be Common Sense ! \" :** 1 : There are some -{ Extreme }- abuse & violence related thematic elements in a film that is rated 'PG-13' ( Or Below ! ) in at least -Fifteen- countries, & that's -just- on IMDb's -very limited- \"Certications\" list, -{ ALONE ! }- . 2 : In a nutshell : the ( entirety ) of the -Story- , per se , feels a little too **-{ \" SIMPLISTIC 🤷‍♂️ \" }-** ; not to mention the picture's almost -{ \"Confoundingly\" }- short, & somewhat \"Disappointing\", frankly, runtime of 97 minutes ; for what is essentially a -{ MARVEL }- cinematic offering. So here is perhaps -{ The }- most significant reason for -Why- that was the case, in my best estimation. Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel, V2's storywriters . . . . -{ collectively }- lacked the requisite experience to rise to the indubitably -gargantuan- task of ( -Adequately- ) enthralling a whole -Planet- ; one that has now become -Altogether- used to watching 'PHENOMENALLY' entertaining Marvel fare, and there's really no other way to say it. Tom, ( whom I 'Admire To Death' as a -performer- , I definitely ought to point out here ), had only two✌ **-STORY-** writing credits to his name prior to V2 , with Kelly logging just three👌 . . . { counting 'Individual' TV Series, but -Not- counting 'Shorts' ( short films ), of course }. 3 : A \" MASSIVE \" Missed Opportunity : It is -indeed- not all that often that we see a quintessential 'Popcorn-blockbuster' flick make a -significant- effort to -Humanize- the villain by way of their -{ Early Childhood Experiences }- , no matter -how- evil they nay be shown as being. For V2 to first -very- SUCCESSFULLY achieve this with the \"Supremely\" prolific actor Woody Harrelson's 'Carnage' ...( finalé )... only to have said moment -Utterly- invalidated just a few cinematic beats later ( -you'll know when you see it- ) was quite the let down, 'Alas' 😔\r\n\r\n**C \" FINAL SUMMARY \" :** I have absolutely -{ N O }- doubt in my mind that had V2 been roughly 'a good 23 minutes' longer ( -At Least- , in order to make for a more \"Marvel-like\" runtime of Two-full-hours ) ; that I would have given it a mimimum score of '8 out of 10', without a moment's thought. -That- , in addition of course, to my \"Titular-gripe\" . . . ( me being the -Doting- parent that I like to think I am ), brings me to the conclusion that this -nonetheless- **{ Undeniably }** Fun, Exciting, \"Idiosyncratic Delight\" of a Movie is -Still- most definitely worthy of -{ 7.50 'Rock-Solid' Marks Out Of 10 }- **. . . .

The Pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none MCU fanatic viewers. The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end.\r\n\r\nOverall, **'Spider-man NWH'** is a Marvel Maniac's Heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them. This is not a stand-alone film and for some this amazing but for many of those seeking to enter the universe this is not at all suitable. This and the poorly grand soundtrack make it 4.5 stars.",

As is usual with marvel property this film is a minefield of links to past and future marvel ventures, but is done in such a way that it truly can be an entry point into the extensive universe without having seen the others.\r\n\r\nThe story develops slowly unwrapping the setting but it also serves to highlight the beautiful cinematic choices Destin Daniel Cretton has made, cinematic shots build to a grand climax with a sufficiently marvel-esque battle between relatable family struggles in unrelatable places and circumstances\r\n\r\nThe end to the fight is satisfyingly predictable and leaves a numbness upon the audience because of the climax's grandeur and its fizzle into the marvel trope of comedic endings.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 Pre and post credit scenes who for the marvel enthusiasts add a great deal of pleasure adn completion to the story and set up the shang-chi subfranchise.\r\n\r\nThis film through all of its achievements feels disjointed and only becomes a cinematic feat  at its climax leaving the audience feeeling as if they could have missed the first 50 minutes and still understood the majority of storyline.\r\n\r\nThis is an great feat of film through its inevitable cinematic, it is extremely enjoyable nevertheless.",

What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action set pieces ever seen.**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick’s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don’t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.",

The story, the action, the laughs, and the cameos make The Flash a worthy cinematic debut for the Scarlet Speedster. The movie tone finds its influences more in the Marvel and Joss Whedon realm than the DC and Christopher Nolan universe, with humor overflowing in almost every scene of the movie. Despite the controversy, Miller’s Barry Allen is well done and entertaining, but the film is not great because of The Flash. It’s great because of all the outstanding fan service to long-time and committed DC fans. Ben Affleck’s Batman pummels thugs. Sasha Callie’s Supergirl unleashes her rage on evildoers. But the best part? Michael Keaton’s return to the cowl. His delight to once again portray the Caped Crusader is obvious, and that infectious joy makes the crowd eat up every scene he is in. The other DC cameos inspired plenty of applause from the theater and, I’m sure, will be entertaining for fans. Despite the nonstop humor in the film, Andy Muschietti creates some very emotional and moving moments that help give The Flash a more potent and satisfying ending. While it’s great, it is not a perfect film. The humor gets excessive in some places, and some of the character arcs end more abruptly than I would have liked, but The Flash is a fun, fresh, and entertaining superhero film that superhero fans can celebrate!",

But the new movie also focuses on a group of annoying teens that constantly get themselves in trouble and peril over and over again throughout the much too long 3+ hour runtime and sidelining better, more established characters. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original at every turn.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film.",

The acting was fantastic as well with Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano offering some standout performances.  The Batman is driven with psychological and mystery focus as compared to the action comedy style of most superhero movies.  My only complaint is that the mystery felt fairly predictable.

I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",

The action sequences are passable, but the story follows such familiar beats that it fails to hold my interest. Thankfully, Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan's performances add some enjoyment to the film, preventing it from being completely dismissible. While I found it enjoyable to watch once, I don't see myself revisiting it. Ghosted offers a more entertaining take on the spy-comedy genre.

The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T’Challa’s passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M’Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett’s performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.",

An overcrowded story with too many characters prevented developing the characters or making the story have any real impact. Forcing two full game stories into an hour and 47-minute run time had consequences. I enjoyed the movie’s attention to the slow descent from human to zombie, which showed the dread and hopelessness as the victims felt their humanity drain away. There is also a fantastic action scene in complete darkness where the muzzle flash provides the only light for the survivors to see. There were some wonderful moments that Resident Evil fans will enjoy, but nostalgia is really the only thing Welcome to Raccoon City has going for it.",

Fury of the Gods had many more characters to juggle, leading to some of the Shazam family being sidelined and the villains being reasonably stereotypical. However, all the charm was still there, helping overshadow these flaws. Djimon Hounsou and Helen Mirren brought some maturity and class to the goofball cast, and Zachary Levi was a blast, as always.

I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn’t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn’t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn’t overdo it.

The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the \"Core Four\" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints! Scream VI is another exceptional entry in the Scream franchise, and I hope we get another one soon!",

Director Zack Snyder skillfully constructs a visually stunning universe, filled with vibrant colors and innovative creature effects. Although the characters lack substantial backstories, they still manage to captivate the audience's curiosity. Snyder also cleverly includes intriguing hints that would undoubtedly entice viewers to return for a potential sequel.

                "review": "Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine",

                "review": "And so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine",

                "review": "Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is \"the second act\" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.\r\n\r\nPicking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There's also the first appearance of Saruman's spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here).\r\n\r\nOther newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King.\r\n\r\nAs we've come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm's Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen's troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film's most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It's just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true of the Ringbearer's quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson's desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm's Deep, it's unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. \r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Caroline Westbrook, Empire Magazine",

                "review": "Get this: what if all we know as reality was, in fact, virtual reality? Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late '90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?\r\n\r\nWhat sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of \"flo-mo\", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean \"talents\" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't.\r\n\r\nImmediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can't get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.\r\n\r\nSure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion's share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There's a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it's been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality. You can bet your bottom dollar George never saw this phantom menace coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Ian Nathan, Empire Magazine",

                "review": "Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\r\n\r\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  \r\n\r\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \r\nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.",

The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again.

This third entry has only one creature, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. When Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a prison planet full of hard-nut slap-heads, they haven't seen a woman in years. Discovering that there's an alien loose, Ripley asks the warden to break out the guns, and can't believe it when she is told there aren't any. Nor can we. Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past, but not here. Dance is slaughtered in the first act, as is the regulation bastard warden (Glover), leaving only Sigourney, impressive as ever, and a motley cast of extras. Though wasteful of the expensive sets, Fincher's tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic.",

                "review": "> So this guy in the red suit came and broke some records...\r\n\r\nI was not a Deadpool fan and I'm still not, but like any superhero films I'd pleasure watching it. The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.\r\n\r\nI am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X-Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spinoff 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.\r\n\r\nThis film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.\r\n\r\n6½/10",

                "review": "Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n‘‘This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",

Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.\r\n\r\nLily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.\r\n\r\n7/10",

That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",

Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.\r\n\r\nI think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?\r\n\r\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

                "review": "> Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8/10",

                "review": "**Horror express.**\r\n\r\nA week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.\r\n\r\nDirected by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.\r\n\r\nBut in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.\r\n\r\n> \"Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.\r\n\r\nIn the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.\r\n\r\nThere are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.\r\n\r\nI have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

                "review": "**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> ❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.\r\n\r\nThis story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.\r\n\r\nTom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nNobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much cliché, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.\r\n\r\nSo the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew. This is a very much watchable film, not comedy riot, but fairly does its job.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

I was a teenager, and I remember celebrating it in the theatre with my friends. But, like the T2, it was too late for a sequel. Most of other franchises are going for spin-offs in the similar case. Anyway, it was good to see the original character back in the action. Although not liked changing the title logo. The original is evergreen.\r\n\r\nWell, the story continued as the same gap between the first and this film. I thought the original concept was like solo action hero kind, but in here, it became a multi-starrer. Like most of the similar themed action film series, it tried to add variety of characters, including clichés like computer hackers and a boss to handle those rogue guys. But there were too many Triple Xes.\r\n\r\nThe story was okay. It only wanted to make a comeback, like a re- introduction of everything. I liked the diversity in the film characters. The casting was from around the world, picking the best team like Donnie Yen from HK, Tony Jaa from Thailand. But I did not understand why Donnie was speaking in Mandarin, instead of Cantonese.\r\n\r\nFrom all I did not like Deepika. Yes, she's the real Indian beauty, but not a good actor, especially for actions, she's unsuitable. I would have preferred Priyanka in here. They two should have switched the films between this and 'Baywatch'. Jaa, I did think he had in him his witty character display. He was a completely different person in this. The rest of the guys were too not bad at all, particularly that stunt guy was awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the action sequences, not some, many were totally impossible. Surely not the really performed stunts they were. Simply a special effects, and it was too much to take on. Because they were not realistically appealing to accept. Those include, non-snow mountain skiing, ocean wave bike surfing, you add it. The good news is, it was okay for watching once, but I'm anticipating the next part to be a game changer in the franchise.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

But for this series, lucky to be the first film to get away with a big hit, mainly because of teen audience.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I liked the 2nd film very much, but the third movie was a letdown, especially this one was utterly useless. Because the 80% of the story ended in the previous part and in this, it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.\r\n\r\nMight have been a better film if the 'Mockingjay' was a single movie. Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money, the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two and/or three. This culture has to stop, the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece, while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback. In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtime.\r\n\r\nDue to the circumstances that I mentioned, the flow was disturbed, mainly because of the release gap between the last two films. Emotions are not felt, actions were weakened, you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion. And that section should have been the ultimatum, what comes later is what we call 'happily ever after or the other way' should have been very brief, but in here it was not. Like a new beginning of a new story, it went on too far.\r\n\r\nFrom the screenwriter's perspective that has to be done. I had seen the split movies like 'Twilight', 'Harry Potter' and others, but this one was the worst among them. Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting, the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slowness.\r\n\r\n5/10",

I'm sorry to say that, but that's the truth. The 'X-Men' series never made me sense, particularly to say it from the Marvel comics is a disappointment. When it comes to 'Wolverine', my opinion is different, because I loved those films. Hugh Jackman as Logan is the only 'X-Men' I love, so like usual this is another waste of time from its series to me.\r\n\r\nI even enjoyed the recently rebooted 'Fantastic Four', but not this one. There's nothing new in the story, it's the same plot stolen from the different films. Like an ancient force is awoken who tries to rule the world by destroying everything created so far by the humans. So the mutants join hands to bring him down and we know what happens at the end. Apart from the vfx, this is very boring film and 150 minutes runtime was another lengthy joke that you never laugh.\r\n\r\nNot just me, many people, even 'X-Men' fans showed displeasure over this film. That means, Bryan Singer's stint with the franchise is pretty much over. So they will going to bring a new one and that's another disappointment, because I don't know how long they're going to drag this series. End it already. Anyway, like I said I never was or will be this universe fan, so I don't care much, rather I just give them a try when they get released and obviously I'm to end in regret watching. Instead, I'm looking forward to the final 'Wolverine' film with Hugh Jackman.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.\r\n\r\nLike the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.\r\n\r\nExcellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.\r\n\r\nI did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway.\r\n\r\nYou are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here.\r\n\r\nThis is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people.\r\n\r\nSo the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part.\r\n\r\nFrom the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world!\r\n\r\n8/10",

Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.\r\n\r\nA family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.\r\n\r\nThe one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",

I had no time to have a quick glance on those before trying this, but while watching this, all the memories came back. It was different. Different means, they wanted the franchise back in action, so they have started with a simple storyline. Everything was predictable in the film, but that was not the point. They a wanted platform, so to move to the better side in the future.\r\n\r\nYuri Boyka was looking forward to take park in a big league, but his last fight did not go well. He won it by a knockout, though the opponent did not survive. That mentally disturbed him, so he wanted to make a few things right. Now, on the eve of the big event, he set to a quick trip to Russia. Why he went and what had happened there, all are the other side of the tale with some good fights and emotions.\r\n\r\nScott Adkins was great. This part kind of reminded me the 'Rocky'. Particularly for the sentimental reasons. The mix of that and stunts were good. Familiarity was the weakness of the film, even though enjoyable. Especially it is for Boyka and 'Undisputed' series fans. They surely would love it. It was a wonderful re-initiation, but hoping better sequels to follow and in a grand scale as well. So when's the next one!\r\n\r\n**6/10**",

                "review": "**Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.**\r\n\r\nBased on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film avoids the usual cliché. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.\r\n\r\nBatman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.\r\n\r\nI'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.\r\n\r\nI already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour. Don't think about that I said, just watch it, it will definitely entertain you well if not blow you away. Surely recommended to all.\r\n\r\n8/10",

However, it didn't realise that 'Saving Private Ryan' took a lot of ideas from old war movies and paid homage to them whilst delivering awe-inspiring and moving scenes of battles.\r\n\r\n'Fury' did not have this. A lot of the dialogue and interaction between characters was laughable. The romance that tried to be thrown in at the middle of the film did not work and just seemed bizarre, The characters were one-dimensional and just seemed like walking stereotypes. The film felt more like 'Tropic Thunder' than 'Saving Private Ryan'. \r\n\r\n'Fury''s lack of long shots of the landscapes and battles meant that the film did not seem as vast or beautiful as other films of the genre.\r\n\r\nHowever, the action scenes were very well done and it was exciting and superbly directed.\r\n\r\n★★★½",

                "review": "When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't know what to expect. I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece. The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew (played by Miles Teller) who is a music student in New York. He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). As his wish starts becoming a reality, he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods. Damien Chazelle's direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play.\r\n\r\nChazelle's screenplay is very well written. It is filled with humour, tension and heartbreak. The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrew's first lesson is expertly done. Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrew's character as he struggles to respond. The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' in that it is both humourous and disturbingly distressing.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this film are remarkable. Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding. The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream. The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless. J.K. Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher. Simmons manages to combine Fletcher's distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability. Simmons reminds me of his character in Valve's 'Portal 2' in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Whiplash' is a fascinating study of passion, ambition and love. The film asks questions about the morality of getting one's dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them. Full of amazing performances all around, and created with such intensity and spirit, my final rating for this film is 4.5 stars.\r\n\r\n★★★★½",

The film is also very similar to Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and David Fincher's 'Seven' as the cinematography is very bleak and dark.\r\n\r\nThe story is disturbingly gripping as the audience view Lou Bloom's rise as an amateur journalist who seems to do anything to get the best footage of horrific crime scenes.

Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by Taron Egerton) is a normal working class 18 year old from London who gets recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Humour comes as he tries to mix with these posh and suave upper-class stereotypes.\r\n\r\nMatthew Vaughn has included his typical ultra stylised violence ('Kick Ass') and it does boast a good sound track. There are a lot of nods to films such as Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but it just reminds me of examples when things have been done much better. The highlight of the film for me was a scene in which Colin Firth violently massacres a crazy church to the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd ('Free Bird') whilst almost seeming like a continuous long shot.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very unoriginal and the dialogue with the young actors in particular is cringe-worthy. Tarantino type set-pieces just come across as annoying as the film fails to have any cleverness or creativity.\r\n\r\nApart from Colin Firth every actor is either average or just really bad. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, is worse than usual as he tries to add some freshness to his regular spiel by trying to affect an annoying and distracting speech impediment.\r\n\r\n'Kingsman' is going to appeal to the intended target age group as it does contain scenes of fantasy violence depicted as \"cool\" whilst characters swear. It would also help your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen the many, many examples where each scene had been conducted much better.\r\n\r\n★★½",

                "review": "Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.\r\n\r\nEspecially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.\r\n\r\nHe of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clichés that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach.\r\n\r\nWe're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.\r\n\r\nReluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.\r\n\r\nThat's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.\r\n\r\nI also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.\r\n\r\nWe also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.\r\n\r\nJust it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says \"we never should have come\", final alien chase.\r\n\r\nThe aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.\r\n\r\nIt's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.\r\n\r\nThe promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged.\r\n\r\nThe characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.\r\n\r\nBilly Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.\r\n\r\nBut at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys.\r\n\r\nFinally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too. But overall not enough action or thought to make this overly drawn out series seem necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I go 5/10.

                "review": "As an avid fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings from long before New Line announced this movie \"trilogy,\" I must say all three films were fairly large disappointments.  Now, mind you, I am not your usual, \"The book is better\" movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That's just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen's stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom's third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books.\r\n\r\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What's most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien's triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose I'll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my lifetime).  In the meantime, I'll continue to read the books every year.",

He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.",

                "review": "\"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.\"\r\n\r\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5/10",

Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10/10",

                "review": "Barrow, Alaska. The most northern town in the United States, where for 30 days every year it is has no sunlight.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect opportunity for a gang of merciless, & blood-thirsty vampires to feed on the remaining inhabitants of this small town, after most leave for the month of darkness.\r\n\r\nAs people are leaving, and others are making preparations for their time of hibernation, mysterious occurrences are uncovered; mobile phones stolen, and destroyed, an entire team of sled dogs butchered. The ground work for the impending doom of a malevolent force.\r\n\r\nOnce the killings and feedings begin there is no let up. I have watched my share of vampire films, and frankly this is definitely one of the best made, its stripped back, bare, and unromanticized. This group of vampires, led by the visceral Marlow (Houston) take no pity on the town of Barrow as they tear it apart looking for their prey, and using people as bait to lure hiding survivors out into the cold and snowed out streets of the isolated mining town.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film becomes a tale of survival, as town Sheriff Eben Olemun (Hartnett) and his soon to be ex-wife Stella (George), lead a group of survivors who manage to hide themselves away by staying in an attic, scared and cold they realize that it is only a matter of time before they are discovered and killed.\r\n\r\nEven though this is a film that does involve a fair amount of blood and gore, the film's real heart lies in the way it scares you with what it doesn't show in the lead up to the early killings, this for me is true horror, show me next to nothing, and build the most amount of tension, then deliver the shock, and you'll have me pissing my pants every time. There is also a fair amount of brutality shown, not only in how the vampires kill their prey, but also how they are dispensed by Eben and the others.\r\n\r\nOn an interesting note, this is a film based on a graphic novel written by Steve Niles, who co-wrote the screenplay to the film. Niles had actually pitched the original idea as a film some years before, but reworked it to graphic novel after being knocked back by several producers, it was then picked up afterwards by one of those producers to make this film we have now.",

The progression of Ripley was really defined by this movie the 'brave but scared' Ripley of Alien is gone and a more determined, meaner Ripley emerges with elements of the older nurturing character kept in check with a young girl called Newt. It definitely stands out miles compared to all the other 80's alien-type movies of that decade.",

Especially compared to Alien (1979).\r\nJames Cameron ruined the spirit and soul of Alien for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first one, according to me, is that, unlike Alien, he is using too many characters. Almost all of the actors are lacking of charism, even Sigourney Weaver.\r\nThe soldiers show more muscles than intelligence and this is not reality, it is almost ridiculous.\r\nI do not understand why Cameron did that. It's unbelievable for a director who made in 1984 Terminator and in 1991 Terminator 2.\r\n\r\nThe second one, is the length of the movie : about 2h20mn. Too long, much too long.\r\n\r\nThe third one is the lack of entertainment. I'm sorry, but, compared to Alien, this film cannot hold the comparison. \r\nIt lacks of depth, and sometimes, it is better not to shoot a second part of a blockbuster.\r\n\r\nI recently watched Chinatown (1974), Rosemary's Baby (1968), Alien (1979), Fatal Attraction (1987) and all of them were great, but not Aliens.",

It is a comfort and a companion to get them through the growing up years. But where does the imaginary friend go when it is used up. Apparently, the word \"imaginary\" needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nBea, played by Cailey Fleming, is a 12 year old girl who lost her mom at a young age. Now her father (John Krasinski) is sick too. Bea moves in with her grandmother to stay near the hospital. Soon she starts seeing everyone's former Imaginary Friends. She is guided by Ryan Reynolds. They are sad and need to be reunited with their formers. Some of those \"friends\" are pretty creepy.\r\n\r\nThe film, written and directed by Krasinski, aims to be kind of like a live action \"Monsters, Inc\". It's really an idea that can only work in animation since it takes out that sense of reality that makes it look too silly. The plot just seems like an idea that has difficulty finding a believable footing.\r\n\r\nIt might work for young kids, for me it just seems forced and overly sentimental. It's easy to watch since Krasinski obviously handled it with care, and Reynolds seems to enjoy his role. But for me that just isn't enough.",

                "review": "While I have found Zendaya to be an attractive and stylish young woman, I haven't really warmed up to her as a serious actress all that much. She was fine in the \"Spider-Man\" franchise since it didn't require any great stretches for her. I feel that in the \"Dune\" series she is overshadowed by other, more talented actors. And in the more serious \"Malcolm and Marie\" she was in over her head in the cheap imitation of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Challengers\" is a big step for her as an actress. And while I do still feel as though her two co-stars were more convincing, I think that this part is a brave move into meatier and more challenging roles.\r\n\r\nThe film is told over a thirteen year period. Zendaya plays Tashi a rising star in the tennis world. She seems to be the next great thing. At one of the tournaments she meets Art and Patrick, played by Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor. They are also competitive tennis players and best friends. And they both fall for Tashi. Who wouldn't?\r\n\r\nOver the next several years they each start a relationship with Tashi. Not surprisingly they grow apart, but their stories continue to intersect as they both move closer to an inevitable confrontation...both off and on the court.\r\n\r\nIt's the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore. It's about people and their feelings, and their ambitions. It's not a sequel or a remake, or comic book. This is why I find stories about real human emotions to be so much more exciting than the latest, generic action retread. The plot is advanced by the things the characters say and how their emotions guide their futures.\r\n\r\nThe film offers ambiguous motivations. On the surface we see them caring for each other, but what lies deep beneath is a much more selfish reality that put them in a survival mode. Each of them is a well written being. There is no hero to the story...nor a villain.\r\n\r\nWhile Zendaya holds her own, Faist and O'Connor are the best part. They move the story and are also the central interest to me. This is, after all a love story, but we don't really understand early that it is also an unconventional one between the two male characters as well. All three of them hold a certain amount of sexual tension between them.\r\n\r\nIf I was to have a small gripe, it would be that the last twenty minutes is stretched too long. I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't rush it like many films do, but...they do milk the final in too many slow motion and trick shots. It adds tension, but it gets close to making us lose a bit of interest as well. Just get on with it!",

They begin a sexual relationship. Lou's father, played by Ed Harris is the town thug, and her sister is repeatedly abused by her creepy brother-in-law JJ (Dave Franco). Violence erupts and soon everyone is scrambling to cover up a murder.\r\n\r\nThe film starts out interesting enough as it builds the characters. By the second half it has begun spiraling as it shifts between so many tones that you don't know which ones to move with. A lot of unintentional laughs and head scratching get more frequent. By the end it is all out terrible.\r\n\r\nAnother serious problem is the way they treat abuse victims. The very people who are defending her...later in the movie are beating her. This is our hero?\r\n\r\nKristen Stewart is a good actress, but Ed Harris is by far the best thing in the movie. The problem is that none of the characters become well fleshed out. None of them are worth hoping for. I don't need my characters I watch to be pleasant, but they need to show some kind of attributes that make them worth following from start until finish.",

It's just that at the end of the day, the villain is weak sauce, there's way too much set up for other movies, and if I'm criticizing Man of Steel for having excessive destruction, I can't give Avengers a pass since they needlessly blow up not one, not two, but three cities.

Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job. One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his, the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception.",

The nuclear bombs used in the Pacific gave Godzilla its super powers, and in the post war it decides to swim towards Tokyo, which of course results in a desperate attempt of stopping the monster. A former kamikaze pilot that had a previous traumatic encounter with Godzilla sees this as an opportunity to get revenge. Apart from a few dialogs and actions from the authors that are more suitable to the Japanese than the American audience, this movie has it all, romance, drama, loss, existencial crisis, and a gory and unstoppable monster. \r\n\r\nWhether you are an old Godzilla fan or a curious newcomer to this type of movie, Godzilla is one of the best movies released this year.",

                "review": "Fantasy drama- comedy adult film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Killing of the Sacred Deer, The Lobster, The Favourite) and written by Tony McNamara (The Great, The Favorite, Cruella), being based on the 1992's novel by Alasdair Gray, that Lanthimos liked and even went to Scotland in 2009 to buy the direct of the movie.\r\n\r\nHaving a victorian semi-steampunk and exquisite atmosphere it tells the story of a newly created woman Bella Baxter, with her body reanimated by the eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, that discovering that after her suicide jumping a bridge she was pregnant, and uses the unborn fetus brain on her head.\r\n\r\nAfter this she went on a journey from a Frankenstein character and develops her tastes and skills gradually till the end of the filme. I must say that some sexual scenes with Emma Stone and her character sexual appetite are most daring and shows how she grow as and actress in all aspect.\r\n\r\nThe main core of roles are Emma Stone as Bella Baxter, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn, Willem Dafoe as Dr. Godwin Baxter and as a lesser role Ramy Youssef as Max McCandles.\r\n\r\nAccording to the cinematographer, Ryan Williams (American Honey, The Favorite) in conjunction with the director Lanthimos used an array of cameras, lens and films included Nikon, Angenieux Optimo and Zeiss Master Zooms, an ultra-wide PL-mount Optex 4mm fisheye, designed for 16mm/S16mm cinematography, that opens up to T2, plus antique 58mm and 85mm Petzvals. Ryan selected EASTMAN DOUBLE-X Black & White Negative Film 5222 for the movie's opening B&W sequences, KODAK EKTACHROME Color Reversal Film 100D 5294 for Bella's elopement and adventures with Wedderburn, and KODAK VISION3 500T Color Negative Film 5219 for the film's denouement.\r\n\r\nThe production design by Shona Heath\tand James Price and the equip of art direction and prosthetics made and incredible job plus with the unique costume design by Holly Waddington (Lady MacBeth, Clash of Titans) also are striking, from the more bizarre childish dresses used on the start of the film to the more adut  on the end. All this with a modest budget of $35 million.\r\n\r\nThe movie have 11 Academy nominations for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score), Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Production Design, Best Achievement in Costume Design and  already have 11 BAFTA awards plus Venice Film Festival 2 awards, Golden Lion Best Film and Yorgos Lanthimos 2023 Winner UNIMED Award.\r\n\r\nI honestly hope that the movie shines and it shinned for me and obfuscated some other movies (maybe only not in best co-adjuvant actress - which we don't have here) at the academy.",

                "review": "Another Zack Snyder movie another wave of haters, so nothing new here.\r\n\r\nI found it pretty well done, the CGI is magnificent on some points; the choice for protagonist as Sofia Boutella (Atomic Blonde) was the best? No. But it isn't so bad. For a movie that is to be his version of SW it isn't bad... reminds me a bit a medieval / western space opera with a Warhammer 40.000 touch. \r\n\r\nAbout being a SW or Seven Samurai \"copy\"..... really? So what? People can tell the movies the way they want, so nothing is absolutely new nowadays, it isn't mind blowing but decent. It is like invalidating SW because we had ST before or Gallactica almost at the same year.\r\n\r\nMy greatest gripe about the movie isn't about the interval between this one and the second movie (April 18th, 2024) so yeah almost two to three years for the complete Trilogy if it hits the public well. \r\n\r\nThe gripe was to put a final fight against the guy that seemed to be the main villain, turns out he is like Darth Maul in the end, and yeah with a confront in the end to have some more action. The real Darth Vader (let's not speak of SW Emperor here because he was the excuse to continue the trilogies). Generally speaking the trio of Snyder (too ambitious), Kurt Johnstad (300 - is ok) and Shay Hatten (John Wick 3 and 4... that almost don't have story) isn't a good choice.\r\n\r\nVisually speaking beside the pseudo-archaic western / samurai setdown (including a bar fight) I found it was an ok choice especially being in the outside worlds of the Empire. Acting was ok, Boutella could have replaced by another actress more charismatic - about the others not much to be said as it is and introduction and gathering of heroes (or rebels if you like the way the title says). Each one have a distinct personality and background yet to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe CGI and practical effects and prosthetics are very nice - Anthony Hopkins as the robot is just really 5 minutes of the movie yet to be seen. The visual of the ships reminded me of those 70's japanese space opera (yep, Space Battleship Yamato it is with other references) with a Warhammer 40k touch to the villains. \r\n\r\nThe edition is good (Dody Dorn of Memento) and Junkie Xl (or Tom Holkenborg - that works mostly with adventure movies) is an ok choice but without any memorable music here.\r\n\r\nOut of the weak ending fight scene (or rush in the history maybe to generate more interest and income for the other two movies) for this one no reason for a major gripe about this one.\r\n\r\nThe biggest let downs are this and the cooldown to see more in more than one year only. And I have a small feeling that all the trilogy won't be enough to fill and the spots left open into characters and development into the story if are all 6 hours total. This is a point that a better screenplay would be needed.\r\n\r\nSo let's wait a \"bit\" more to see where it leads. From my point of view a 6.5 out of 10.0 / B- for now. \r\n\r\nDon't listen to the Snyder haters, watch and judge for yourself - I had more a 70's japanese space opera feeling for this one than SW.",

Nolan beautifully explains his life both on a private and professional front. The music, the sounds with each scene are top notch.

It's a historical biography with fantabulous acting by C.M., E.B., R.D.J. and more. The scenes with ALBERT EINSTEIN are just wow. A plethora of scientists(BOHR, FERMI, TELLER, HEISENBERG) of the age can be seen throughout.  There are no action scenes if you are in search of that. \r\n\r\nIT IS A CINEMATOGRAPHIC BRILLIANCE.

But here we are.\r\n\r\nAfter an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.\r\n\r\nWhat I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.\r\n\r\nI adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",

In short, I came away enjoying it and unhappy with how this movie was portrayed in the movie-review media. I think it was just a piling on of the mob-mentality reviewers who tried to kick somebody who was already down, but anyway, I do hope this gets a sequel and I do hope the filmmakers continue with the campy, unintentionally funny, very quiet scenes with no theme music whatsoever style, low-budget-but-still-decent CGI, and over-all enjoyable moviemaking which can be watched and enjoyed for an hour and a half.

                "review": "The Godfather Review by Al Carlson\r\n\r\nThe Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.",

Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the \"Mafia\" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.\r\nThis is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.\r\nThe movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. \r\nThere just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It's totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.",

Yet even he has some humanity left in him, but he hardly shows it.\r\nThe other three are the tank commander (Brad Pitt), who handles brutality of war with objectivity, his second, who handles brutality by trying to be right with God, and the other one uses comedy to handle it.\r\nI've been in the military, and it is quite common for \"clerks\" to be tossed into war like cannon fodder, because that is what \"clerks\" are viewed as being by everyone else, from officers down to the one stripers.\r\nIn fact, the clerks are considered to be the most disposable members of the forces. \r\nWe know that today. People didn't always know it in WW2.\r\nThe final self sacrifice at the end seems a bit much, but when you take into consideration that it's a spare of the moment decision, and mistakes are made with quick decisions, it's plausible. Not probable, but plausible.\r\nAlso, the final battle scene with five men doing so well against an incredibly larger force; well, that is sold to us by the amount of smoke around the tank, and the fact that if you are on the other side, surrounding the tank, you wonder if you are shooting at your own teammates across from you. \r\nI think it would have been a better movie if the five soldiers all just abandoned the tank and tried to walk back to safety, but that's just me.\r\nOther than that, it was an exceptional film that passes all the tests.",

There is none. It's a muddled mess. It appears that by the end, the chief mobster is in anguish over whether or not to kill his brother. \r\nWhy? Who knows?

                "review": "In my last review (which you can find on my Letterboxd), I said _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ was a \"nearly perfect film.\" Well, I am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. \r\n\r\nI used to always think this film was a sort of step below LOTR, and, while LOTR is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, I don't regard this film as lesser.\r\n\r\nThe movie is just pure magic! Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI – which doesn't really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.\r\n\r\nThe score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially \"The Battle\" – that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it's actually about halfway into the track \"Evacuating London.\") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.\r\n\r\nAlso, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don't know how they can top this opening. \r\n– In fact, that's another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don't think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. – Oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can't top that.\r\n\r\nAlso, the costuming is excellent – especially for the White Witch – and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).\r\n\r\nAnd I can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.\r\nEdmund represents us – represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that “if [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved” (Romans 10:9), we “will not perish but have eternal life” (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (from Romans 5:1).\r\n\r\n‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬10‬\r\n\r\n> “[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”",

The story was interesting, it had some scary parts, some humorous parts, lots of tension, was well-acted, well-shot, and the effects (both practical and CGI) were well-done. Also, the production design and creature design was great.\r\n\r\nA movie doesn't have to be restricted to either being \"the best\" or \"horrible.\" The theater I saw it in was packed, the audience was responsive and seemed to be loving it, and I myself enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nI didn't really play the games, but I was definitely engaged in the lore of some of the MatPat Game Theory videos I saw. And I could tell from audience reactions that there were some cool things in the movie if you knew the games. That's not a negative, to be clear. It's always really cool when filmmakers put things in movies that true fans would catch and geek-out about.\r\n\r\nAs far as being a viewer who didn't really play the games, I enjoyed the movie. And while I think knowing the games/lore would have definitely enhanced my enjoyment and enthusiasm, I wouldn't say it lacks as a movie or that the games are \"required viewing\" for those who haven't played them. Everything's explained pretty well.\r\n\r\nAs far as the horror aspect goes, it is PG-13; I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of gore... It's PG-13. C'mon guys.\r\nBut, that being said, I thought they still did a good job with the horror elements that were present.\r\n\r\nI also really liked the trio of main characters. I thought Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, and Elizabeth Lail all did a good job.\r\nAlso, I'm glad Josh Hutcherson is back. I hope he'll continue to be in more movies.",

There’s nothing redeeming about it, with every decision either ill-conceived or mishandled to the point of incompetence. In Favreau’s hands, ‘The Lion King’ is rendered thunderously dull, lacking in any tension or complex characterisation, taking a laboriously long time to go nowhere and never once justifying its contentious existence. Even with my dislike of the original, I was flabbergasted at how thoroughly this film never attempts to understand why so many people love the 1994 film. If nothing else, this film makes it abundantly clear that Disney has no interest in making great cinema or honouring its own legacy. They don’t care whether the film is good or whether you enjoy it. All they care about is using nostalgia to trick you into buying your ticket so they can make as much money off you as they can, and maybe if they throw some recognisable iconic moments from your childhood on the screen, they may even be able to fool you into thinking you’d had a good time. ‘The Lion King’ is the ultimate diabolical apex of the commercialisation of nostalgia, and its inevitable box office success will just prove how easily we continue to be duped and how thoroughly they have trained us to not care about the quality of what we see. If this really is the future of mainstream cinema, then we are in serious, serious trouble.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-lion-king-a-catastrophic-and-soulless-remake-of-a-disney-classic",

There were some good lines, and the scenes where Mike and Marcus were together obviously shine in an otherwise dull film. Fans will also go nuts when a character from a previous 'Bad Boys' film makes a return cameo appearance. Look - 'Bad Boys 2' was one of those rare films where the sequel was better than the original, so there were a lot of high hopes riding on #3, especially given the exceptionally long period between drinks. But I'm afraid all those expectations have been crushed, and what's left is a mediocre offering that will go down as the third best 'Bad Boys' film... possibly until 'Bad Boys 4' arrives.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-bad-boys-for-life-whatcha-gonna-do-when-theres-nothing-new",

Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) gets a look-in once again after her very disappointing absence from 99.99% of ‘Endgame’, but she’s wasted on screen, serving little to no purpose. And while this film finally gives us a Peter/MJ love story, it’s all too familiar territory - not because of the characters involved but because we saw Peter pursue a crush in ‘Homecoming’. We also saw him try to balance the student/hero sides of his life then too. This is THIS Peter Parker’s fifth time on the rollercoaster. We’ve seen him and fell in love with him as the sweet, innocent kid who had greatness thrust upon him and his thirst to be a superhero. He had his shot in the ring - several times in fact - and now we need to see him grow, but they’ve just given us much of the same. We need to know where this is going, not just watch a kid play dress-ups time and time again.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-spider-man-far-from-home-in-a-post-iron-man-world-spideys-still-the-same-insecure-kid",

Also, the \"real-ness\" of the animals make some scenes way more scary for children.\r\n\r\nThe choices made in this are....strange.  \r\n-The voice casting is weird (some African sounding, some American, and others in between) - like there was no plan.  \r\n-Extra scenes and dialogue do not add to the movie and even lessen it when compared to its predecessor.  \r\n-The way the songs have been re-done/ recorded are just wrong and **this is the first Zimmer score that I have not liked** in....forever (it feels like he just phoned it in).  \r\n-And a baby warthog suddenly appears at the end near Pumba, but no mother...WTF?\r\nThere is still a plot though, so there's that... which means its better than the shambles that was Rise of Skywalker or Cats.\r\n\r\nYet another movie to forget.",

There is actually an urgency in his battles with the JL now.  And OMG, Darkseid and Desaad look and sound boss.  \r\nThe recruitment is harder, the fight between the JL and Supes and then the JL and Steppenwolf is more brutal, and Superman's 'recovery' is better paced and makes more sense. \r\nThis also follows directly on from BVS and links directly into Aquaman. \r\nAnd the closing cover of Hallelujah is glorious (it near comes close to Jeff Buckley's angelic version)\r\n\r\nIt's flaws - Timing of release - I need to watch this in a cinema.  FU WB for not giving Snyder the time to finish this as he envisioned.  THIS is what we should have gotten, not the tripe that was Josstice League.  This movie shows that Snyder was not just trying to catch up to Marvel, he was their own version of their stories and it should have been allowed to come to the end of the cycle.  \r\nAlso, I was underwhelmed by the score and would have loved Zimmer to have returned to complete this.  \r\nAnd there are a couple of initial set-up scenes that could have been let go or shortened and the gapping continuity error scene in the middle where the JL get introduced to Alfred after theyve already met him should have just been left out. \r\n\r\nBut we got what we asked for - the Snyder Cut in its entirety. \r\nAnd I am grateful for that...thankyou.\r\n\r\nNow, could we please create ZSJL2 so we can see the Injustice and Darkseid stories.",

As a busy software engineer with a penchant for quality family time, I couldn't have asked for a better choice for our movie night.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the film began, it whisked us away on a whimsical journey into the magical world of Wonka's chocolate factory. The visual spectacle and attention to detail were captivating, and I found myself marveling at the creativity on screen. The vibrant colors and imaginative set designs truly brought the beloved story to life.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Wonka apart is its ability to strike a perfect balance between nostalgia for those familiar with the classic tale and a fresh, modern twist that keeps the storyline engaging. The characters are charming, and the casting choices are spot-on. Timothee Chalamet as Wonka brings a new energy to the character, and his performance is both endearing and entertaining.\r\n\r\nI came across this movie at :\r\nhttps://mustwatchmovies.xyz/movie/114901/wonka\r\n\r\nOne aspect that stood out to me, as someone deeply involved in technology, was the seamless integration of CGI and practical effects. The visual effects team did a commendable job, creating a world that felt both magical and believable. The attention to detail, from the intricate machinery in the factory to the playful Oompa Loompas, was truly commendable.\r\n\r\nWonka is not just a feast for the eyes; it also delivers a heartwarming message about the importance of imagination, creativity, and the joy of shared experiences. As someone who manages an affiliate network and values family time, I can confidently recommend this movie for a fun-filled outing with loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Wonka is a cinematic delight that appeals to the child in all of us. Whether you're a parent looking for a wholesome family film or just someone who appreciates a well-crafted story, this movie is a must-see. Grab your tickets, some popcorn, and treat yourself to a heartwarming adventure that will leave you with a sweet taste of nostalgia.",

                "review": "Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet’s performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.\r\n\r\nThe film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothee Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.\r\n\r\nOne has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.",

                "review": "The Last Jedi started with a very tense emotion, capturing all viewers' attention tightly including mine (I've seen all movie episodes of Star Wars series so this type of scenario should look familiar to me).\r\n\r\nThis tense and epic feeling filled the entire film, so even it is a bit lengthy, people won't sleep over :) however, the scenes involving Rey and Luke on the isolated island planet look super quiet and mindful. It was similar to the scene in previous episode when Luke was seeking help from the Yoda Master. However, it felt more complex, because never had Yoda been described being evil, not a bit.\r\n\r\nOne tiny detail that I felt redundant and unconvincing was the reincarnation of Leia Princess. How did she fly back to the ship? As far as I can tell, no reason is given in the film. This lets you suspect whether she was going to be who can command the Force like a Jedi, but well all you can do is just suspecting.\r\n\r\nAnother critical option that I had to express was about the role of Kylo Ren. He is a complex character, and I am not sure that he believed in until the very end of the story. The climax of this complexity arrived at the scene when he killed Snoke and fought along with Rey, trying to persuading her to come for *a new world*. But this complexity simply came and disappeared. The story continued in the old way and our powerless always furious Ben Solo kept playing a simpleton role of any typical bad guy. The role is depicted as, adequately complex, but not consistent and lively enough (compared to the former Lord Darth Vader).",

The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt's sooo romantic. She says “Fuck me”, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again 😍😍😍\r\n\r\n————\r\n\r\n“365 Days - This Day” is like “Fifty Shades of Gray” for sexually frustrated amoebas like Dr. RTL2's summer question page is filmed as if the Netflix executive suite was personally shitting in your brain, in slow motion. Infuriatingly misogynistic, absurdly badly acted and of course at number 1 on the Netflix charts. When is there a power outage when you need one?",

                "review": "Released in 1986, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> is Stanley Kubrick's film about Vietnam, adapted from a novel by the reclusive and bitter Vietnam veteran Gustav Harford, and then further expanded by acclaimed Vietnam journalist Michael Herr.\r\n\r\nThe film breaks down neatly into two very different parts, though both are seen through the eyes of young United States marine J. T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine). In the first act, Davis makes his way through Marine basic training with a motley group of other recruits under the hellish command of gunnery sergeant Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey). Joker watches as Hartmann bullies an overweight and dim-witted recruit cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), until Pyle explodes into murderous revenge. In the second act, now set in Vietnam where Joker is doing a tour of duty as a military journalist, the protagonist and his fellow Marines find themselves on the front line during the Tet Offensive and Joker witnesses firsthand the savagery of war.\r\n\r\nFew films consist of such drastically opposed parts that differ in setting and tone and don’t have any overlapping characters besides the protagonist (and one minor character from the boot camp scenes). <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> has often disappointed viewers because the first half is so thrilling that it proves a hard act to follow. That's all down to R.&nbsp;Lee Ermey, who actually was a drill instructor during Vietnam and initially served only as a technical consultant before Kubrick decided to let him play the role and improvise. Ermey acts with a white-hot intensity, realism, and brilliantly worded insults and obscenities that no screenwriter could ever have come up with.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, I too felt that the film was a letdown once it moved past the witty quips and goofy camaraderie of the boot camp scenes. With time, however, my appreciation for the film as a whole has only grown. The two-part structure now seems to be a strong yin-yang structure: the first act is a vision of order, while the second is all chaos. Furthermore, the second half is a moving statement of how war is often senseless. Joker and his squad, while on patrol for an enemy they cannot even identify and whose ideology or culture they know hardly anything of, begin to be targeted by a sniper. Several men perish before the sniper is found and neutralized, and all that death is pointless: it doesn't contribute in any way to victory for either side. The brutality of World War I trench warfare, where dozens of men could perish for merely a foot of conquered ground, is shown to have persisted through the American quagmire in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its flaws. One is the unrealistic depiction of the Vietnamese landscape. Kubrick had a great fear or dislike of foreign travel, and he insisted on shooting the whole film in East London. Having merely a few palm trees shipped in is a poor replacement for a real Southeast Asian shooting location with its humidity and insects, and in the scene that is meant to show a lively Vietnamese town square Kubrick obviously had the same few cars driving around in circles. It's strange how a director who was generally so perfectionist, could be so careless about locales (this only got worse with his next and last film, <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, with its inauthentic stage set New York City). There are also some anachronisms that this director and his technical advisors should have noticed.\r\n\r\nStill, even a flawed Kubrick film is classic cinema.",

At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.\r\n\r\nThe film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a \"two buddies on the road\" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a \"spaghetti Western\", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.",

                "review": "_The Flash_. First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. \r\n\r\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character.\r\n\r\nThe movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it \"multiverse\" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist...\r\nThe movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn't go well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are. It seems that Barry Allen didn't learn shit from this two-hour journey.",

The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.",

                "review": "**My rating: 10/10**\r\nWhy? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.\r\n\r\n**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).\r\n\r\n**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.\r\nSpidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. \r\n\r\n**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.\r\n\r\n**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.",

                "review": "There may be some fine performances in this movie, but I honestly think the critics overrated this latest entry in the X-Men saga. The performances of Wolverine and Prof. X by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are extraordinary. They create a believable and loving father-son bond between their characters, with Logan caring for the ninety year old leader of the X-Men after a horrible event occurs at the Xavier school the year before. Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from Tómas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies. Merchant is quite good in the role. But what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. The other X-Men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. A sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. This movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of Days of Future Past, where the X-Men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. Death seems to stalk Logan and Charles wherever they go. There is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. The only female of note is Laura/ X-23, and she spends most of the film mute. There is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains. No one ever reaches the level of greatness like other X-Men villains such as Magneto or William Stryker. So, despite some good performances, this film is a bit overrated and also a little too bleak and depressing for my taste.",

It's not up to the excellence of this summer's Wonder Woman film, but it's quite fun to watch. What made this film better than some of the other previous DCEU films is that it has a sense of humor. Previous films were rightfully criticized for being too dark and humorless. Gal Gadot is the stand out as Wonder Woman. This film did a better job in its portrayal with Superman. In Man of Steel, he battled Zod, which resulted in massive human casualties, without a care, which does not fit the character at all. That made me mad as a Superman fan. Here, he shows concern for innocent civilians, flying away with an entire building of people to make sure they would not be harmed in the battle against the villain. The one weak spot is the Big Bad, Steppenwolf. He's a rather fake looking CGI creation that lacks depth. But he's only the precursor to the REAL villain--Darkseid. The two end credit scenes are entertaining. The last one teasing the formation of the Legion of Doom/ Injustice League is particularly intriguing.",

Cate Blanchett as the villainess Hela, the Goddess of Death, is a far better villain that TDW's lame Malekith. Kat Dennings' annoying Darcy and Natalie Portman's bland Jane are not missed at all. Instead, we get Tessa Thompson's badass Valkyrie, who can hold her own in a fight and isn't just there just as a love interest for Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Grandmaster, who runs the gladiator fights on the planet Sakaar. But the real pleasure of the movie is watching the love-hate brother relationship between Thor and his adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The relationship between the two men was the only redeeming feature of TDW, and it's great to see it expanded in this movie. Also great is seeing Thor buddy up with Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fate of The Warriors Three. They deserved better than that. But otherwise, it's a great comic book movie.",

Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy.

They've taken their characters a step further here in a script that allows them to explore themselves emotionally more than ever before. This movie is strictly part-drama. Yes, that's right. Finally, a Marvel superhero movie you can confidently stamp the drama genre tag on.\r\n\r\nThe effects, stunts and gore are really quite shocking. You can really feel the weight of each character's immense power, and more importantly, the struggles that come along with them. This further fleshes out each character.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts to lose the enjoyability of its ensemble halfway through, and what happens after is what you might expect from a typical X-Men film. Action, sci-fi and more action/sci-fi. The villains are as interesting as they can be I suppose. They lack much development but are there to fuel the real story. Anyway, I can't say much else without spoiling the plot. I'll just say that I wish the movie would have taken a different direction.",

Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.\r\n\r\nI think that is also the reason of the high score. To me the movie quality is more of 5 ~ 7 out of 10.\r\n\r\nJust don't think too much when watching it, but I don't think that is too big a problem for the target audience.",

                "review": "There's a recurrent metaphor throughout the film, of Hanuman trying to eat the sun leaping towards it Icarus-like and being stopped by the gods eventually. Maybe Dev Patel was aware of how well this metaphor would encapsulate his brave directorial debut too, all throughout the film he's trying to reach the narrative he wants to tell but he eventually pulls his own punches. Only if he knew his film would eventually not release in Indian theaters at all, howmuchever he restrains himself.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this is a highly enjoyable film. But the commentary on the current Indian society and what is plaguing it and all the classist and casteist divides we have setup within ourselves -- all of that comes out a tad bit feeble and a bit too watered-down.\r\n\r\nYou can see Dev touching majorly on religious blind-faith intermingling with politics, but also offhandedly on caste and patriarchy too -- there's even a montage of real-life videos of a few of these evils thrown in for good measure -- but everything is a bit too sanitised and it doesn't jolt you. Not for a single moment did the film drown me in itself with these thoughts, always swimming on the surface. Water and fire are another recurrent tropes which occur throughout, another piece of foresight by Dev on how his fire would eventually be watered and we would just swim on the surface of it.\r\n\r\nHaving said that all out, I completely dig the film for its action and how it tries to mix Indian music and instruments throughout. **There's Zakir Hussain in it ffs, now THAT is what true cameos should be like, completely unexpected and swooping you in.** I've always liked Dev's performance and here he proves he's as good behind the camera as he is on it. It was great to see familiar Indian faces as well. There's also one homage to _Ghajini_ in there which I feel was a great nod.\r\n\r\nOne last piece of critique and then I would leave: the fictional cities and villages all feel lived-in and real, but at the same time a little bit Westernised too to be uniquely identified as Indian.",

                "movie_title": "Joker",
                "movie_countries": "Canada, United States",
                "review": "Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, “‎Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...”. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.",

                "review": "Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I’m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I’ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It’s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We’re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn’t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere’s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur’s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can’t or won’t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It’s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that \"Joker\" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn't without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between \"excellent\" and just \"okay,\" and sometimes even \"meh.\" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.",

                "review": "The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo’s, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an \"in\" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn’t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don’t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience’s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do say it’s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we’ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn’t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren’t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It’s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don’t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don’t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn’t essential to it.\r\n\r\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don’t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I’ve seen in 2019. Highly recommended!",

As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background \"monster\" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story.

                "review": "**Year of release** 2014 **Directed by** Bryan Singer **Written by** Simon Kinberg **Starring** Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Peter Dinklage Ellen Page\r\n\r\n**X-Men: Days of Future Past** (rating: 4 ++)\r\n\r\n**Plot** - In a dystopian future of 2023 where mutant-kind has been all but wiped out by powerful robots known as Sentinels the last surviving mutants launch one final attempt to save their species from extinction. Hiding out in a monastery in China, Kitty Pryde (Page) sends Wolverine's (Jackman) consciousness back in time to 1973. His task is to prevent Mystique (Lawrence) from murdering the Sentinels' creator Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). His murder made him a martyr and ensured that his destructive creation went into production. In addition, Mystique is captured in the process and her DNA used to engineer even more powerful machines. By stopping the murder the hope is that they will change the future and save their species. Seeking out the young Charles Xavier (McAvoy) Wolverine is despondent to find that he is not the man he will come to know decades later. With Xavier a broken man, Wolverine's first challenge is to help him find his old strength. The next challenge isn't one that sits all that well with Xavier; they must break Magneto (Fassbender) out of a prison cell beneath the Pentagon. To do so they enlist the aid of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant with superhuman speed. With Magneto and Xavier once again standing side-by-side they head to Paris to attempt to stop Trask's murder at Mystique's hands, but will they make it in time?\r\n\r\nIn a fitting move considering the storyline of this film allow me to go back in time to the year 2000 where I can still remember going to see the first X-Men film in August of that year. Hard as it may be to believe, the big superhero film was not the guaranteed box office success they are nowadays. Following the disastrous reception that met 1997's Batman & Robin the superhero genre was on life support, and another big failure could have seen the plug pulled. Thankfully for all us fanboys out there the film proved to be both a critical and commercial success, kicking off a surge in comic book films which has seen them come to dominate the box-office. Well somehow 14 years have passed since then (and I can't quite believe that :eek:) and we now have the 7th film in the X-Men franchise. Now since the solid start of X-Men the series hasn't exactly been the most reliable in terms of quality and has been rather overshadowed by the Batman's, Spider-Man's, Iron Man's and Avengers' of this world. In truth you could probably split the previous 6 films evenly into 'the good' and 'the not so good'; though to be fair to The Wolverine which I'd put in the latter category it's pretty decent. Well as the 7th film in the series this was always set to break the tie and the good news is that it has swung the pendulum very much towards the positive side of things. \r\n\r\nThat said however I didn't find that I was quite as high on the film as many other people seem to be. As seems to be the case for just about every other superhero film these days, the release of DoFP has seen many people instantly jump on the bandwagon of proclaiming this the best superhero film ever. While I certainly wouldn't go that far this is an extremely entertaining entry into the X-Men franchise, and one that continues the upswing of First Class. The film does open in absolutely thrilling fashion and ends quite strongly as well. In between these wonderful bursts of action though I just found that the film had a tendency to fall into a lull on a couple of occasions. With its complicated story the film has to spend a lot of time trying to keep things clear for the audience, which sadly results in the situation and the stakes being reiterated time and time again. It just threatens to get bogged down by becoming overly talky, derailing the momentum and in general I didn't feel it was as well paced as Captain America: The Winter Soldier for example. An additional action sequence or two I don't think would have gone amiss. I also feel that it perhaps lacked the colour, energy and sense of fun of X-Men: First Class. Some of that comes from the fact that I didn't feel DoFP embraced its period setting to the degree that First Class did which on more than one occasion felt like a Sean Connery Bond film. A few snazzy outfits and some brief touches upon the Vietnam War aside I don't think it really exploited the 70s era to the fullest. And I think the Vietnam sequence was actually amongst the film's weaker moments; an unnecessary detour which could easily have been left on cutting room floor.  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the opening sequence of DoFP is a terrific way to kick the film off; in fact I think its got to be one of the best opening gambits of any superhero film. The film instantly drops us right into the middle of a Sentinel attack upon the X-Men in the future; making for an absolutely thrilling opening. It's a wonderfully creative sequence that features  some genius choreography as the hitherto unknown Blink (played by Fan Bingbing), with her ability to create teleportation portals, emerges as one of the most visually dazzling mutants we've seen so far throughout the series. It's a terrific set-piece that the film arguably never matches for the next two hours, at least in terms of action and excitement; there is a sequence however that is fantastically entertaining which we'll get to later. The big finale then aims to be and mostly achieves feeling like a suitably epic affair that encapsulates Sentinels, the White House and the RFK sports stadium. At the same time the film is also jumping back and forth between this and the future where the Sentinels have once again launched an assault upon the X-Men. The only problem, and one that is in complete contrast to other superhero films such as Man of Steel, is that I didn't feel its concluding battle was quite long enough. The two competing sequences feel like they are slightly lacking in action and drama, and are over too soon.\r\n\r\n**Film Trivia Snippets** - In reference to the X-Men member Kitty Pryde, and her importance to this particular film, DoFP was shot under the working title of “Hello Kitty.” /// Days of Future Past is based on a storyline of the same name that appeared across two issues of Uncanny X-Men in 1981, and was written by Chris Claremont. It is now the fourth film to be based on a story penned by legendary X-Men writer Claremont. X2 was adapted from 'God Loves, Man Kills'; X-Men: The Last Stand was based on his 'Dark Phoenix Saga'; and The Wolverine was based on his comic of the same name. In the comic the future world was set in the year 2013, the same year in which filming for the movie version began. /// The bullet wounds that appear on Wolverine's chest on his arrival to the 1970s is in the form of the Big Dipper. This is an homage to the 1980s anime series, Fist of the North Star, whose protagonist Kenshiro has the same scar pattern on his chest. /// Prior to making the film, Bryan Singer had a two-hour discussion with James Cameron abut how to make a time-travel concept feasible and workable within the film. Thanks to Cameron's experience as the director of The Terminator and Terminator 2 the two discussed concepts including alternate universes and string theory (a field of quantum physics that define multiple universes). /// It's quite clear just by looking at the credits that this is one hell of a cast that's been assembled. If you're looking for more proof however then how about this; the four main female X-Men in the principal cast (Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Ellen Page and Anna Paquin) are all Academy Award nominess, while the six principle male cast members (Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Peter Dinklage) are all Golden Globe nominees.\r\n\r\nWith such a prestigious cast at Bryan Singer's disposal it's no surprise to find that performances across the board are generally of a high standard. Though the sizeable cast means that not everyone gets an equal chance to shine; Halle Berry's involvement for example is little more than a cameo. In fact I'm struggling to think if she even had a single line throughout the whole film or if all she did was make it rain a little bit. And the whole future ensemble are almost completely sidelined, meaning that the established regulars are given little to do other than spout some exposition, while the various new additions (Bishop, Blink, Warpath, Sunspot etc) are given absolutely no introduction whatsoever so we have little reason to care about them or mourn their demise. In fact for the majority of them I'm not even sure there names are known until we get to the closing credits. The lack of exposure given to the future timeline was certainly a disappointment. As a result it's in the past where the most noteable performances come from with solid efforts coming from Lawrence, Fassbender, Jackman etc. However the one individual who is able to stand out from the crowd for me would have to be James McAvoy who I thought was just excellent as the young Charles Xavier. The fact that he is given the strongest characterisation and the most to work with certainly helps. We initially find him as this supremely broken individual who is in great pain both physically and emotionally, but with help from Wolverine he is able to find his way back onto his path. \t\t\r\n\r\nThe two most notable additions to the X-Men world this time out were Evan Peters' Quicksilver and Peter Dinklage's Bolivar Trask. And as it turns out the end result for both was completely flipped from what many were predicting beforehand. The promo images for Quicksilver had fanboys already sharpening their knives before the film had even hit cinemas, ready to tear into him with the kind of fervour reserved for Batsuit nipples and Ben Affleck. And yes I have to say that his appearance still comes across as rather bizarre and stupid, kind of like Julian Assange as styled by Lady Gaga. As a character however he kind of kicks ass, his introduction arguably being the coolest addition to the franchise since Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler back in X2. And just like Nightcrawler had with his incursion into the White House, Quicksilver is given the spotlight all to himself at one point to really make a name for himself. This time it's a break-out from the Pentagon where his incredible speed comes into its own with a terrifically fun and inventive set-piece that allows him to steal the film from his more illustrious co-stars before sadly disappearing shortly afterwards. The way he is just written out is rather disappointing and feels like it's only been done to help free up space for everyone else. It does however leave the audience wanting more, so it's good news that he's going to be starring in X-Men: Apocalypse. My only concern about the character is whether they've actually made him too powerful. They show his abilities as being so strong that you imagine he could destroy any mutants, even the likes of Magneto and Xavier, before they even had the chance to respond.\r\n\r\nThe real disappointment amongst the cast is Dinklage's Trask. Now Dinklage is a great actor, no doubt about that, and I think he personally does good work here. It's just that the character he is lumbered with here I felt was a little bit dull to be honest (particularly for the film's supposed 'big bad'), giving him very little to really sink his teeth into. That also creates one of the film's few main flaws in my eyes; the lack of a strong villain. Trask kind of takes the place of Senator Kelly from the first X-Men film, but that film also had Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants as villains. While the future X-Men do face off against the considerable threat of the Sentinels they are a fairly blank entity devoid of an actual character or personality that can interact with the X-Men. Which is not to say they are not effective foils for our mutant heroes, you just get the feeling that there should be big bad in charge of deploying and controlling those machines. In terms of design the Sentinels may disappoint and likely anger the real X-Men fanboys out there, baring little resemblance to their comic book counterparts. In fact they aren't a million miles away from The Destroyer as seen in the first Thor film. However I don't think there's any denying that they most certainly do make an impact; in fact they are rather chilling, unsettling creations. The fact that the X-Men suffer some very violent, nasty deaths certainly heightens that feeling.\t\r\n\r\n**Film Trivia Snippets** - Bryan Singer talked about \"changing history\" in an interview with Empire Magazine(May 2014). The director stated \"I don't want people to panic about us erasing the movies. I believe in multiverses,\" explaining the possibility of certain events as they would be part of the history of alternate universes. /// In the \"Days of Future Past\" comic it was Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) who went back in time; in the film it's Wolverine. According to writer Simon Kinberg, Kitty was intended to be the time-traveller but it didn't work out: \"Kitty in the era of young Magneto and Xavier, would have been negative 20 years old. The reflex response to that was a character who doesn't age. Wolverine is the only character who would look the same in 1973 as he does in the future.\" Thus, Wolverine was picked for being an ageless immortal character who would bridge past and future. /// To create the sensation of Quicksilver's incredible speed ability Bryan Singer filmed his scenes in a special format of 3600 frames per second. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 150 times faster than normal. /// Josh Helman was originally going to be cast as a young Cain Marko/Juggernaut. But Juggernaut was written out of the film, and Helman was offered the role of a young William Styker. /// Bryan Singer based Bolivar Trask on Adolg Hitler; “As Hitler used the Jews as a scapegoat to bond the darker parts of Europe, he's doing the same thing with mutants. But he wasn't a six foot, perfect blond Aryan - he was a short, funny looking fellow!” \t\t\r\n\r\nNow considering the fairly dense and complicated storyline that encompasses two timelines and what feels like dozens of characters I think that the film's writer, Simon Kinberg, actually does a fairly commendable job of keeping everything in some kind of balance and managing to just about ensure that it all makes some kind of sense. And considering the twisted mess of continuity that he has had to deal with it would perhaps be unfair to poke holes at it. But hey these are films for comic book fanboys, what do you expect but for us to nitpick! :D The film is still unable to address a few niggling questions, perhaps because that continuity mess makes it almost impossible to actually do so. However questions still linger such as how exactly is Charles Xavier still alive after being killed off in X-Men: The Last Stand? What's the deal with Wolverine's claws and their constant shifting back and forth between adamantium and bone? Still no explanation as to why Xavier and Mystique didn't appear to know each other in the original trilogy, but were so incredibly close according to these films etc. The script has to spend so much time just trying to establish the story that there is little chance to focus on the actual characters at its heart. As someone who loved the Magneto-Xavier relationship and interaction in First Class that's a shame. And it feels like there is barely a single line of dialogue in the whole film that isn't exposition\t\r\n\r\nThe script also fails to address a few new issues, just completely glossing over them perhaps in the hopes that we just won't notice. For example when and how exactly did Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde get the ability to send people's consciousness through time? And perhaps it's just me but the whole plot point (and it's a very important one) about Mystique's blood being so vital in the development of the Sentinels seems rather vague and questionable in its logic. If they were going to go down that route I feel Rogue would have been a somewhat more logical choice given that her ability is to replicate the powers of other mutants, not just change her physical appearance. It kind of came across as them just trying to shoehorn Mystique into being as important as possible to the film, largely inspired you suspect by the meteoric rise of Jennifer Lawrence since First Class. In fact with Hugh Jackman getting on in years, and his days as Wolverine coming to an end, the search is on to perhaps try and find the new face of the franchise. With Channing Tatum set to take on the character of Gambit he seems like a decent bet to take over that mantle. However with Days of Future Past they certainly seem to be positioning Jennifer Lawrence as another possibility to take on the role if she were to extend her current deal. I doubt anyone would ever have predicted Mystique being pushed to the fore in such fashion. Oh and just as another little nit-pick; was I the only one who thought the make-up job for Mystique looked rather s*itty this time out? I think it looks a lot more fake now than it ever did even 14 years ago.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJust a few more thoughts to wrap up. After the fresh start that was First Class, bringing Wolverine back and once again making him a central figure feels like a little bit of a step back. While he's only had two official solo films this almost films like the 6th Wolverine-focused film we've now had in the series. And if you're going to bring him back I think you should at least use him correctly. His strongest feature for me is as a brutal, kick-ass warrior, but DoFP actually gives him surprisingly little opportunity to unsheathe those iconic claws of his, placing him more in the role of a diplomat trying to keep the peace between Magneto and Xavier. The fact that the film kills so many of the mutants introduced in First Class offscreen I found quite disappointing. And the use of Blink's portals aside I didn't think the film quite captured the same team dynamic that was present in First Class, with several of the team going off on solo missions or taking their enemies out all by themselves. And now a couple of other little things that I liked. While we get to see very little of it the wasteland that the Earth has become in the future dystopia is a very effective and stirring touch, and one that evokes the future war as seen in the Terminator films. Oh and one little touch that I really loved was the film recreating newreel footage of the decade to match actual footage from the era. It comes off looking like the Zapruder JFK film. \r\n\r\nAmongst fans of superhero films, 2008 is seen as a bit of a holy grail for the genre; the release of both The Dark Knight and Iron Man, two of the most acclaimed and loved entries so far, gaining it that reputation. 2014 has so far seen the release of two great efforts (The Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past); if Guardians of the Galaxy lives up to the promise of its trailers then we could have a new contender for that title of comic book movie's holy grail year. \r\n\r\n**Conclusion** - I know I've been pointing out a lot of flaws with the film in this review (perhaps as a response to all the gushing over it) but the truth is I did still find it to be an extremely entertaining addition to the X-Men series. As a result of some of those flaws however I'm not quite as high on it as many other people seem to be. For the moment I would have it in 2nd place amongst 2014's superhero flicks behind the excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and after one viewing it would slot into 3rd place amongst the X-Men films.\t\r\n\r\nOne thing I should definitely add however is my condition when watching it. As I have been for a great deal of time recently I wasn't feeling particularly great when I went to watch it; feeling rather run-down and a bit yuck. So that perhaps hindered my enjoyment slightly,meaning there's a chance that score could rise on a repeat viewing.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bonus Film Trivia** -  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were performing in a touring production of \"Waiting for Godot\" when Bryan Singer approached the actors about reprising their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. According to McKellen, both men were utterly shocked as they thought they'd passed their roles on to James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, and would never play the characters again. Both Stewart and McKellen were delighted to return to two of their most popular roles, and to work with the younger actors playing the same characters as well. /// When Matthew Vaughn was going to direct, he was going to make the film a direct sequel to X-Men First Class and have it set in the 1970s. Early ideas included an opening with the Kennedy assassination being caused by Magneto, and mutant encounters set in the Civil rights movement/the Vietnam War. When Singer took over, he integrated these concepts into a viral marketing campaign to set up the action of the film. In this alternate history, Magneto is arrested and imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy, but maintains his innocence. The \"Bent Bullet\" Theory (a reference to the real life \"Magic Bullet\" Theory criticized by conspiracy theorists) holds that the Warren Commission determined that Magneto manipulated Lee Harvey Osawld's bullets to kill the President in retribution for the murder of the mutants Azazel and Tempest by the CIA. Conspiracy theorists, based on Magneto's testimony, insist however that Magneto had tried to prevent the murder of Kennedy, and that the true shooter was not Oswald, but Mystique in disguise who, with the help of Emma Frost framed Magneto, and manipulated Jack Ruby into later murdering Oswald. The theory also posits that Mystique offered to double as Kennedy in an attempt to grab power, all of which backfired horribly, leading to anti-mutant hostilities.",

                "review": "    As a child, I remember catching David Lynch’s “Dune” on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.\r\n\r\n    The gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \r\n\r\n    In reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \r\n\r\n    Early in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \r\n\r\n    There are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\r\n\r\n    With that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\r\n\r\n    I do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\r\n\r\n    The film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.　Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \r\n\r\n    I have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. \r\n\r\n    When it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). \r\n\r\n    In conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.",

Of course having Leonardo in the lead role helped a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the trailer, I already know some things. Dreams. All about dreams. But what about dreams? Who are the other people? At first, I didn't really understand what was going on. It was all very confusing to me. But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A.",

                "review": "Today I enjoyed: Damsel.\r\n\r\nDamsel is a Netflix Original, that was released just a few days ago. Starring a strong cast with Millie Bobby Brown, Robin Wright, Angela Bassett and the voice of Shohreh Aghdashloo it follows the odyssey of Elodie. I am not going to spoil the plot for you, but I bet you can foresee most developments, dear reader.\r\n\r\nOverall I have mixed feelings. The story is nothing new, most elements are well known for this kind of movie. Some decisions of characters (including the dragon) feel dumb, and sometimes our main character gets very lucky, so the rest of the plot can happen. The CGI ranges from poor to pretty good, poor more in the begging, with huge landscapes and castles, but later, when the dragon makes an appearance, it looks pretty decent. But I was watching on a rather small screen and Netflix is punishing me with mediocre quality for some time now. So take my visual rating with a grain of salt. Now one thing I will say about the dragon: It has an interesting spin to it. For one thing, half of the time, we do not really see it and only hear Shohreh Aghdashloo's deep, rasping voice, bringing it to life. And when we actually see the dragon, it has a slight horror touch if you will. It looks like a hybrid between your average majestic and broadly loved dragon and something more dark and slimy. A muskrat comes to mind. I liked that (sort of).\r\n\r\nOne remark towards the title: While it is obviously a play the well known 'Damsel in distress' and obviously Elodie fights instead of needing to be rescued, she screams a lot and actually seems in distress half of the film. Until she suddenly becomes the hero and single-handedly fights the dragon. It is a bit much and hard to believe.\r\n\r\nThis is in all honesty an average movie. It is neither terrible nor great. If you are in the mood for some imagery, gold and jewels, dragons, princesses, and a few swords, then go for it. There are worse ways to spend roughly 109 minutes. But there are also better ways.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted on my blog: https://robingierse.de/blog/tie-damsel._",

                "review": "Today I enjoyed: Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say it up front: The only good thing about this movie - was the bad guy.\r\n\r\nRebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire was originally thought to be a Star Wars story. However, Disney did not like what Zack Snyder had to offer, as he wanted to build a new story with new characters and more gore than the original Star Wars movies. And after seeing the movie, I get a sense of why Disney took a rain check on it.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a shot of a young female farmer, working hard on a field in a what seems to be medieval, maybe viking village, only contrasted by the huge red orangish planet in the background. But here the problems already start. Nothing looks real. You instantly get this uncanny valley kind of feeling, that something is off.  This opening scene already reveals that almost everything was shot in a studio in front of a huge LED screen - called a stage craft - and you recognize this throughout the entire movie.\r\n\r\nAnd as if that was already bad, there are constant J. J. Abrams style lens flares, the CGI at times feels lazy at best, I honestly started to question if I was seeing a live action movie, or some animation flick. To be fair, I watched it at home on my TV, as Netflix - who eventually took on Snyders project - decided to put this film directly on the stream, skipping the cinema screenings.\r\n\r\nThe saddest part in my humble opinion though is, that there are actually competent actors involved, like Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam and Bae Doona, but the movie does not facilitate their skills at all. Hell, even Sofia Boutella can literally kick ass, if you give her some good action scenes. But while the former actors get way to little time to bring their characters to life properly, the main character played by Sofia Boutella mostly stands in the background of her own movie changing from frowning to slightly smiling, depending on the occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started on the fight scenes. The very first fight scene, which has an intense setup and a lot of potential felt really odd. From the style, I was expecting some blood at least, but the movie stays on a weird line between rough close combat, that would justify bloodshed on the one hand and classical PG13 rated laser gun fights on the other. It looks like the more gory parts were cut, which makes sense, if you consider that the word is, there will be a second version coming. A Snyder Cut, if you will, that is considerably longer than this version and way more brutal. But time will tell, if that is true and if it will be the better movie. But I doubt, that even that longer version will provide enough background story for the characters and the full universe the film takes place in.\r\n\r\nThe only silver lining - as already mentioned in the beginning - is Ed Skrein as the antagonist. He delivers a chilling science fiction version of a Nazi general, reminiscing Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. He acts gentle and civilized at first, only to switch to brutal maniac in an instant, showing his real face.\r\n\r\nOverall this motion picture was a big disappointment. I am a big fan of science fiction and I can forgive quite some mistakes. But this was too much after all and even with all the good will I could find in me, the flaws are just too obvious.\r\n\r\nMaybe part two will make this movie whole, maybe it should have been a single film in the first place. But my recommendation, if you are not a die hard science fiction fan, is to save these two hours of your life for something else.\r\n\r\n*Originally posted on my blog: https://robingierse.de/blog/tie-rebel-moon-part-1.",

                "review": "**Movie Review: Damsel (2024)**\r\n\r\n**Plot Overview:**\r\n\"Damsel\" is a fantasy film that subverts the classic 'damsel in distress' trope. Set in a medieval world, it follows Elodie, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who is tricked into a marriage with a prince only to find out she's to be sacrificed to a dragon as part of a centuries-old pact. The film takes a turn from fairy tale to survival as Elodie uses her wit and resources to escape her fate.\r\n\r\n**Themes:**\r\nThe film explores themes of self-reliance, empowerment, and the subversion of traditional gender roles. It challenges the narrative of the passive female character, presenting a heroine who is capable and resourceful.\r\n\r\n**Character Development:**\r\nElodie's character arc is central to the film's impact. She evolves from a young woman resigned to her fate to a fierce survivor, fighting not just for herself but for the future of her people. The supporting characters, including the prince and the queen, add depth to the story, each revealing their own motives and complexities.\r\n\r\n**Director's Style:**\r\nJuan Carlos Fresnadillo directs with a clear vision, blending action with fantasy elements. His use of contrasting settings – from the snowy village to the opulent royal court – adds to the film's visual appeal.\r\n\r\n**Performances:**\r\nMillie Bobby Brown delivers a strong performance, capturing Elodie's transformation convincingly. The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone and Robin Wright, provide solid performances, though Angela Bassett's talent is noted as underused.\r\n\r\n**Technical Aspects:**\r\nThe film boasts impressive production design and costumes, creating a visually stunning medieval world. However, some reviews criticize the CGI as cheap-looking and the action sequences as repetitive.\r\n\r\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\r\nStrengths include the film's strong lead performance, innovative plot, and beautiful set pieces. Weaknesses lie in the script and some performances that fail to engage, along with technical aspects that could have been executed better.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:**\r\n\"Damsel\" is a film that offers a fresh take on the fantasy genre. While it has its flaws, the film's strengths make it worth watching for those interested in a modern twist on classic fairy tales.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Damsel\" is a bold attempt to redefine a genre steeped in tradition. It's a film that will resonate with audiences looking for strong female leads and a story that champions individual agency over destiny. Despite its shortcomings, \"Damsel\" is a commendable addition to the fantasy genre and is recommended for its unique perspective and engaging storyline.",

I think the great accomplishment of Lily James is her non-verbal communication of this central theme to \"have courage and be kind\" in the midst of the vicissitudes of life, just as Cate Blanchett's non-verbal communication of jaded bitterness masterfully supplies the melancholy contrast of devious conniving.   James brings love into her little world while Blanchett's legacy is her two spoiled rotten daughters played marvelously by Holliday Granger and Sophie McShera.  This remake brings a lot of humor to help get the message across-- primarily in Helen Botham Carter, the hairy Godfather, I mean, the fairy Godmother-- whose quirky kindness charms and delights.  The animals too, as Ella's constant companions, add to the humor.  The casting in this film utilizes the actors' talents quite well. I found myself watching this over and over again, at least parts of it, for the sheer joy of its message.  In a world of negativity, there is something very real about simplicity and purity, if only in a love fantasy.  \r\nA final note must be added about the music-- it contributes its share to the film's message most beautifully.",

This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a 5 minute standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",

                "review": "\"Robert Zemeckis remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films\"\r\n\r\nThe first time I have ever redacted a critic was down in 2015, since then, I learned how impressive productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film as absolute perfection score.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay. \r\n\r\nFinally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.\r\n\r\nThe audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!\r\n\r\n(90/100)",

                "movie_countries": "United States",
                "review": "Well another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.\r\n\r\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\r\n\r\nSo what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\r\n\r\nLeading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\r\n\r\nFor Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nOn top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).\r\n\r\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.\r\n\r\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n**Captain America: Civil War (2016)**\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 26 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Bruhl, Alfre Woodward, William Hurt\r\n\r\nDirected by: Anthony Russo and Joe Russo\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga/Action and Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic’s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**",

                "review": "Hail to the Science Fiction gods as they came to their senses and granted upon the eagerly movie-going masses the long-awaited arrival of a stunning and opulent _Blade Runner_ sequel. Perhaps we should praise the understated genius and visionary mastermind Ridley Scott for his 1982 directorial accomplishment in serving up what appeared to be an underappreciated and overlooked SF thriller in its heyday over three decades ago only for it to emerge now as one of the greatest Science Fiction futuristic capers worthy of its cult classic following?\r\n\r\nMaybe the long overdue kudos are reserved for the diehard nostalgic _Blade Runner_ bunch whose committed and fanatical fandom was the key catalyst for this undeniably brilliant, brainy, dazzling and polished presentation to resurface and give new vitalizing breath and striking energy to the Science Fiction genre in conception? Could it be possible that Hollywood simply saw opportunistic and healthy box office receipts to restart another pop cultural juggernaut from yesteryear’s cinematic scene?\r\n\r\nIs there a returning Harrison Ford fixation/fetish blossoming courtesy of his past blockbuster film resume that boasts the obvious inclusion of prominent SF/adventure fantasy biggies such as both the _Star Wars_ phenomenon and the _Indiana Jones_ installments with _Blade Runner_ now taking up the matinee mantle?\r\n\r\nRegardless of the film-making forces at hand or the key reasoning for this 164 minute visually arresting odyssey updated and packaged for bombastic _Blade Runner_ enthusiasts and dedicated SF connoisseurs the proof is in the proverbial pudding as **Blade Runner 2049** has made its auspicious presence known and succeeds thrillingly as an indelible wonderment in imagination, intrigue and intelligence.\r\n\r\nBreathtakingly rich and vibrant in its overlong execution, **Blade Runner 2049** is a lustrous escapist epic that resonates with snappy pop, thought-provoking tendencies and atmospheric grittiness that soundly resonates. And yes…the participation of the aforementioned and omnipresent Ford reprising his role from 35 years ago is indeed the appealing and motivating factor to re-enter the anxiety-driven world of intrusive replicants,  societal annihilation and the guessing game of humanity infiltration.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the intense workmanlike charm and structured suspense in the rebooted **Blade Runner 2049** has not missed a single beat as it colorfully brings its brand of contemplative tension and underlying humorous texture to this sumptuous spectacle. Importantly, the film’s philosophical edginess and saturated cynicism stays true to Scott’s unflinching vision of introspection about the valued properties of life and who are the chief architects of such a unique gift of existence. Consequently, speechless Science Fiction audiences once again are transfixed by the mesmerizing yet old adage about the rivaling ‘have’s and ‘have nots’ especially so vital in the gloomy squalor and doomsday darkness that Scott created so fervently in his vintage edition that set the stage for renegade blade runners in a power struggle with defiant, roguish replicants disastrously flirting with the sacred boundaries of humankind.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Denis Villeneuve (‘Arrival’, ‘Sicario’, ‘Prisoners’) has stepped into some pretty mighty cinematic shoes in dusting of the mothballs of _Blade Runner’s_ haunting and hedonistic past in an accomplished effort to bring forth a percolating potboiler of a challenging and imaginative hue to its succulent successor in 2049 with surging, exquisite aplomb. Screenwriters Michael Green (‘Alien: Covenant’, ‘Logan’) and Hampton Fancher (‘Blade Runner’, ‘The Minus Man’) manage to brilliantly convey the dystopian disillusionment as the caustic yet compelling commentary concerning the decline of humanity and how it is feverishly on the brink of non-existence. The fuzzy lines are crossed for the calculating chaos and corruptible wheels that are turning so aimlessly and shockingly. The sins of sinners, good, bad or indifferent, gloriously are stemmed in moodiness and mystery. Additionally, notably iconic cinematographer Roger Deakins (‘Fargo’) cultivates a dank, hazy-coated landscape where shadowy imagery compliments the dour suspicions of determined man versus durable machine co-existing in a hostile futuristic fantasy world of techno-dismal dimensions. Also, kudos are reserved for Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch for their soaring, energetic score that undercuts the tension and turmoil.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Ryan Goslin (Oscar-nominated for 2016’s ‘La La Land’) is a young blade runner known as ‘K’ whose mission is to track down veteran Rick Deckard (the returning Harrison Ford…also a former Oscar nominee) in the aftermath of a major uncovered secretive revelation that requires the missing senior badge-flashing blade runner’s undivided attention. The problem remains, however, is that Deckard has been out of circulation for three decades and so the search is on for K to hunt down the long-absent Deckard.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Officer K’s critical and contemplative police work is, to mildly put it, seek out the about-to-expire, unpredictable and resistant replicants and eradicate them when necessary. The replicants, mechanical menaces with artificial intelligence that are living among the humans incognito, are the main focus of the LAPD and K enthusiastically is immersed in the manhunt for the hidden techno-tyrants with militant mindsets that could strike at any moment among the walking flesh. K strives to put them out of their mechanical misery as his sworn duty to serve and protect but he is handcuffed (no pun intended) by the political politeness and procedural proprieties as pushed by his boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Basically, K is under surveillance based on his fragile mental state and Joshi is the one to contain this gritty-minded cop’s wandering psyche.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there is undeniable texture and intensity that fortifies **Blade Runner 2049** due to the layered and complex story that effectively taps into the robust realm of man’s possible mercy call at the dominant feet of advanced and sophisticated technology. This observational sentiment certainly rings true in contemporary times as selective human beings feel lost, intimidated, overwhelmed and need to surrender to the mounting shifty pressures of an exposed society seemingly ruled by sinning opportunists on both sides of the shady aisle, mechanisms rendered equally with blood and bolts.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly, **Blade Runner 2049** is devoutly cerebral in passion and old school perception. Oddly, Villeneuve’s mixture of science fictional roots and thought-provoking dramatic art house probing works while adding a realistic and somber milieu of existential foreshadowing. Gosling is gloriously geared as the hound dog-faced law enforcer too close for comfort on the fringe of film noir-style burnout as he gets embroiled deep into an abyss of head-scratching discoveries. Ford does not miss a single beat as the gravel-faced, handsome-aged Deckard saddled in adventurous mode despite the matured years since his early 80s heyday in the mundane, ground-breaking _Blade Runner_ blueprint from yesterday. Oscar winner Jared Leto (‘Dallas Buyers Club’) joyously lets it all hang out as the wickedly off-kilter character Niander Wallace. The feminine inclusion of Wright’s top policing babysitter Joshi and Ana de Armas as K’s love interest, Joi, are welcomed personalities. Ex-wrestler/actor Dave Bautista (hot off the ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ film series) is a larger-than-life specimen as always in proven popcorn blockbusters.\r\n\r\nConvincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body **Blade Runner 2049** is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well.\r\n\r\n**Blade Runner 2049** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

                "review": "Words cannot express how incredibly overwrought, insipid, hyperactive and foolishly exaggerated the third entry into the action-packed _XXX_ film franchise is in the nonsensical and numbing operative spectacle **XXX: Return of Xander Cage**. Monosyllabic muscle-bound action star Vin Diesel revisits the rollicking and roguish skin of athletic spy/sports enthusiast Xander Cage in yet another splashy yet sophomoric throbbing thrill-ride that only diehard Diesel fanboys will swallow with unapologetic fervor.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt Diesel knows where his bread is buttered in terms of his secured box office appeal. The pumped-up performer has initiated the hoopla with a couple of popular action flicks in the past only to leave them briefly before deciding to return front and center. Diesel has done this tactic with the inexplicably desired _The Fast and the Furious_ movie series as well as the aforementioned _XXX_ offerings (actor/singers Tyrese Gibson and Ice Cube inherited the big screen honors in replacing the absent Diesel in these energized ditties respectively). Now Diesel is called into service once again to capitalize on the extreme spy genre while satisfying those thrill-seekers whose thirst for the James Bond and Jason Bourne action-grabbers may be perceived as relentlessly mild as the acrobatic antics of the hip Bald Bold One looks to overshadow his competitors in daunting dumbness.\r\n\r\nBottom line: who the heck was cramming for the ridiculous return of the attention-getting Xander Cage other than the motivated machismo of star/co-producer Diesel strutting his all-too-familiar slick shtick in an empty-minded vanity project that is jumpier than a kangaroo with the hiccups? There is nothing like playing to the convoluted escapism and exploiting the loyal demographics that continue to get a charge out of Diesel’s boisterous brand from the _Fast and Furious_ enterprise that still sizzles for some and fizzles for others. Nevertheless, this espionage eyesore features Diesel’s Cage at his best…and that is not saying much. He is as smooth as ice soothing your ailing tonsils. Check. He is a chick magnet to the highest degree. Check again. He can turn his biceps and brawn into an invaluable weapon for the safety of his country and comrades. Double check and then some. Overall, we get it…Xander Cage is a badass without boundaries and daredevil Diesel and his on-screen cohorts wants to reinforce such titillating tripe. Go figure.\r\n\r\nGranted that **XXX: Return of Xander Cage’s** sole purpose is to play into the pulsating popcorn pleasure of its audience while expecting one not to take the excitable escapades too seriously. Still, the tired formula for this particular genre in general (not to mention a Vin Diesel-starring vehicle) feels utterly uninspired and recycled despite the ambitious showcasing of active triggers that include high-wire skiing through the woods, dirt bike surfing, daring skateboarding prowess while clinging to the side of a moving bus and oh yeah…a lot of colorful butt-kicking tactics to boot. The highly stylized lifestyle of the free-wheeling Cage is by-the-numbers hedonism–cause havoc, conquer the lovely ladies hormonal for his suave affections and come off looking cool this side of 70’s knockoff bad motherf&%$# private eye John Shaft in taking care of business. Great spy work if you can conjure it up for indiscriminate action junkies wanting to engage in this souped-up silliness without rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite familiar with the Xander Cage “mythology” he was an extreme sports talent that had been recruited by NSA head honcho Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to utilize his competitive skills and abilities undercover. Now Cage is back in the saddle as he horses around on yet another challenging assignment that finds him butting heads with a trio of baddies in Deepika Padukone’s Serena, Donnie Yen’s Xiang and Tony Jaa’s Talon–a threatening threesome experimenting with dangerously rigging outer space satellites or something to that trivial effect. Of course the crafty Cage–beyond wily and reckless–is often reigned in by the likes of his superiors including Agent Jane Marke (Oscar and Emmy nominated Australian actress Toni Collette needlessly toiling away in this toothless contraption of a spy thriller).\r\n\r\nDirector D.J. Caruso (2016’s “The Disappointments Room”) merely goes through the motions with this disjointed spy caper that flexes its moronic muscles without offering much else to the preposterous proceedings. The displayed dialogue in a Lucky Charms cereal commercial has more credibility than the words leaving the lips of the featured players in this woefully generic actioner. Diesel, who has shown some promise as an actor in previous critical fare from yesteryear such as 2000’s _Boiler Room_ and 2006’s _Find Me Guilty_ has since played it safe and relied on the frivolous “sure thing” with the repetitive Furious installments and other fluffy movie projects that had diminished his potential in Hollywood beyond the brainless blow-em-up cinema that he finds automatic comfort in churning out as a cinematic safety net.\r\n\r\nAlthough they say that a single “X” usually marks the spot it takes triple X’s to disprove this theory when welcoming back the chaotic coolness that is Diesel’s detached dude in cocky-minded Xander Cage–the sensationalized showboat that should have left his debuted one-dimensional adventurous tendencies back in 2002.\r\n\r\n**XXX: Return of Xander Cage** (2017)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)",

                "movie_countries": "Germany, United States",
                "review": "The Hunger Games creator and mastermind Suzanne Collins has brought to life the explosive and resilient heroine Katniss Everdeen (not to mention the resourceful actress stepping into her action-oriented shoes and consciousness in the form of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence). Now with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy. However, the question remains: does Mockingjay--Part 2 fulfill the adventurous swagger of its previous predecessors as it demonstrates its furious farewell in moodiness and mischievousness? Well, the answer is a resounding YES but some will still address the concept of the film's emotional and psychological leanings as merely serviceable to a string of feisty films that invited such passion, pronouncement and promise in its commentary on class struggle and societal survival means as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe Hunger Games cinematic installments (and of course Collins's riveting literary outlets) have always been a solid and secure movie-going moment because it offered what so few action-packed features entailed: a perceptive and honest if not hedonistic look at the politics in the human psyche set aside from the rough-and-tumble sequences of action and suspense. The Games that were played in the minds of the audience were intriguing, thoughtful, compelling and smart about its wits and wisdom. All The Hunger Games editions were message-driven and presented a special kind of indescribable opulence and openness that was refreshing. Sure, there are the highs and lows that comes with the territory when mapping out a showcase of sequels bound to stumble on its lapses in story and characterization. Still, for the most part The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 leaves the viewers wanting more but being compliant with what amounts to be the swan song for courageous cutie Katniss Everdeen's big screen legacy. \r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 and its previous outings has carved a decisive niche into the Young Adult film fiction genre as one of the most successful and consistently received chapters that sparkled in its over-glow of gallant gumption and soul-searching turmoil. Indeed, Mockingjay--Part 2 does add its measurement of tension, radiance,  redemption and resolution. Importantly, Mockingjay--Part 2 maintains its reflective and steady balance of hope and rebellious vibes and Lawrence has not lost a single ounce of momentum in the few years since she donned the respectable defiance of the roguish Katniss out to settle a continuous score with the controlling powers-that-be.  Instinctively, labeling The Hunger Games motivating movie series as a pop cultural phenom would not risk the intention of sounding overdramatic because for the most part this film franchise has been a saving grace to the aforementioned Young Adult film fiction craze that has offered cemented substance in comparison to the soapy sentiments of the immense Twilight umbrella that spread like wildfire in the unguarded woods years before.\r\n\r\nAs one can imagine Mockingjay--Part 2 picks up where the first Mockingjay left off in its initial premise. Director Francis Lawrence (back at the helm) starts his narrative rather slow and plodding but builds up the sassy momentum as his on-screen victorious vixen Katniss Everdeen pounces on her latest exploits to expose and agitate the corruptible Capitol and its lead manipulator in the likes of the diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The good news is that the determined Katniss is finally reunited with her former Games companion and romantic partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). The bad news is that poor Peeta has been manipulated and convinced to view Katniss as an enemy courtesy of Snow's menacing minions. Automatically, this is the difficult wedge that puts a damper on Katniss's ability to go after Snow and his vile followers with Peeta serving as their brainwashed Boy Wonder with the forced hatred in tact. \r\n\r\nSo now the course is set for Katniss Everdeen to follow as she decides to pursue her intentions of gradually taking down the governmental negligence of Snow and his abominable administration. Naturally, Katniss needs the assistance of the rebels under the tutelage of District 13's President Alma Coin (Oscar-winner Julianne Moore) as well as the input from wily gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (late Oscar-winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to take down the dangerous and devious Snow and his governmental criminal cronies. Politically, the opportunistic Coin wants Katniss in her camp for the mere promotion of propaganda...something that just does not sit well with the feminine avenger.\r\n\r\nThe stakes are understandably high but Katniss is in company with the likes of her childhood sweetie pie Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and old-time buddy Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) as they join forces to combat the evil clutched of the Capitol. The bottom line: the venomous President Snow needs to be cut down in his treacherous tracks...plain and simple. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, the beleaguered Katniss is caught up in the complicated web of a couple of political powerhouses in the insufferable Snow (that wants to destroy her) and Coin (that wants to use her reputation for marketing purposes) willing to go at it while using Katniss's exposed neck as the sacrificial pawn to determine their sense of twisted greatness. For the most part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 does present a skillful display of confusion and identity and Lawrence's death-dodging diva Katniss Everdeen is the epitome of a Girl on Fire with flames of indecision and doubt burning all around her. Who can she trust? Who has the fortitude to stick with the plan and ensure that the tedious target of Snow is silenced for sure? Can Katniss overcome the obstacles of her great love Peeta's perverse distaste for her while battling one narcissistic leader as another one she is joined at the hip exploits her presence? There seems to be a constant continuity for conflict in warfare and wounded souls that elevates Mockingjay--Part 2 as a boisterous board game of physical and psychological movement. As usual, Lawrence's Katniss carries the animated strife on her dainty yet athletic shoulders with bouncy boldness. \r\n\r\nAfter four exhilarating films, The Hunger Games empire does not crumble but comes to a full scale halt as it understands the allegory claims for the distrusting contemporary times we all live in regarding the cynicism, abuse of privilege and the underestimation of the weary masses being led astray by the controlling elite of unassuming movers and shakers. The audacity of The Hunger Games odyssey was to get down and dirty about the give-and-take tendencies of a global society willing to challenge the authoritative scrutiny or kneel at its merciless ankles. Perhaps Mockingjay--Part 2 should not be perceived so deeply in its final revelation. Nevertheless, the effort in trying to do so should be acknowledged for an actioner that dared to approach such thought-provoking fodder within its bombastic boundaries. \r\n\r\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 (2015)\r\n\r\nLionsgate Films\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 17 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Elisabeth Banks, Mahershala Ali, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Paula Malcomson, Stanley Tucci, Michelle Forbes\r\n\r\nDirected by: Francis Lawrence\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction and Fantasy/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars) \r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2015",

                "movie_countries": "United Kingdom, United States",
                "review": "The kinetic super-spy caper ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ will serve as a boisterous blueprint for those teen fanboys out there that will fancy an elaborate overload of James Bond-esque high-powered hedonism. It certainly does not hurt that the high-wire hysteria as showcased in the twitchy ‘Kingman’ is based upon the acclaimed comicbook series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. Also, add into the mix the movie-making overdrive pedigree of director Matthew Vaughn (‘Kick-Ass’, ‘X-Men: First Class’) and slick, cheeky spy-spry send-ups that recall the over-the-top espionage genre and its exaggerated suspense-driven foundation. Well, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ is a cockeyed, pulsating parody that works its ultra-violent magic for the Austin Powers crowd that wants to walk on the high-octane wild side of Bond’s universe.\r\n\r\nSure, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ has its iffy moments where the blatant sexist overtones, magnified violent sequences and a generous bloody bounce of excess will have some stomping their feet in sheer indignation. The apparent knock on ‘Kingsman’ will be its robust ridiculousness and familiarity in Vaughn’s ‘Kick-Ass’ cartoonish vibe. However, the same elements that may cause some reservations with the film’s low-brow lunacy is also the same ingredients that trigger ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’s carousing charm in majestic mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe grand gimmick behind behind kick-starting ‘Kingsman’s go-for-broke rollicking is casting the sophisticated presence of the Oscar-winning Colin Firth (‘The King’s Speech’) as dapper Harry Hart (aka ‘Galahad’), a polished and prominent superspy for a British secret intelligence society.  Hart’s top-secret spy network is headed up by Arthur (Oscar-winner Michael Caine). The secretive operation is based out of a notable tailor’s shop known as Kingsman. Also worth noting is that all the secret service agents are named after the famed knights of King Arthur’s Round Table. Go figure. In any event, the suave Harry Hart is the debonair face of the spy organisation and will play a critical part in both recruiting a young up-and-coming agent with decent physical skills and tracking down a worldwide menace bent of destroying the planet. It is all in a day’s work for the skilled, well-dressed licensed-to-kill operative.\r\n\r\nHart, who had been loyally connected to a fallen colleague from a past mission gone disastrous years before, decides to become a mentor for his late co-worker’s troubled son Gary ‘Eggsy’ Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) whose law-breaking conduct catches the attention of the police. Feeling a sense of responsibility for his deceased spy buddy’s wayward kid, Hart takes Eggsy under his wings and determines to shape the misguided youngster into resilient Kingman stock. After all, Eggsy has the needed physicality (we are told he is an exceptional gymnast) and roguish spunk to join the ranks of the seemingly understaffed spy outfit. Soon, Eggy and other recruits will be grilled through rigorous training from Kingman member Merlin (Mark Strong) as they look to fill the spot vacated recently from the dead Lancelot.\r\n\r\nThe dearly departed Lancelot, it turns out, was the latest victim of ruthless criminal mastermind Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). The flashy Valentine, a billionaire gone bonkers, hopes to control the world’s climate change. He is known as a mega-wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist but his sinister heart yearns for some heavy-handed dastardly deeds that puts him on the immediate radar for Hart and his crafty Kingsmen to spring into action. At the demented Valentine’s side is the deliciously disabled exotic henchwoman Gazelle (Sophia Boutella) with the treacherous knack for disarming her adversaries with blazing blades.\r\n\r\nThe bombastic and eye-pleasing ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ sets out to have one goal in mind: to highlight its thunderous homage to spygate spectacles that salute everything from the Agent 007 flicks and related free-wheeling 60’s fare such as the ‘Matt Helm’ and ‘Derek Flint’ spy franchises to the recent espionage vehicles that invite the millennium-based harried heroes such as the Jason Bournes and Jack Ryans of the world into the frenetic fold.  It is fast, furious and unapologetic in its rambunctious spirit as a ricocheting romp.\r\n\r\nVaughn, in all his rousing Tarantino-esque tactics, unleashes a visceral assault that is visually wrapped in his escapist package of an adrenaline rush. Wisely, Vaughn incorporates some of his ‘Kick-Ass’ colourful calisthenics to arm his playful spy yarn. As the veteran spygame squires, both Firth and Caine are game for the frolic they signed up to participate in with puckish aplomb. Jackson brings his usual explosive badass persona to the table as the villainous fashion plate Valentine. The 14 year-old males will draw their adventurous inspiration from Egerton’s junior spy Eggsy Unwin. Some may become nostalgic when uncovering the likes of spotting ‘Star Wars’ icon Mark Hamill as an imperiled climate changer scientist caught in the crazy clutches of Jackson’s diabolical antagonist. \r\n\r\nAlthough not the most inventive take on ridiculing the spy genre with over-extended finesse and sensationalism, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ is still a preferred jolting distraction at the beginning of an early stillborn movie season.\r\n\r\nKingman: The Secret Service (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr. 40 min.\r\n\r\nStarring: Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Michael Caine, Samuel L.

                "review": "One would think that the ultimate showdown between two of the most iconic super-heroes would make for some downright compelling action-oriented exploits against a landscape of angst and destruction. Plus, it certainly did not hurt that exhilarating filmmaker Zack Snyder (‘300’) was at the helm in bringing together the colorfully and concocted confrontation between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. Also, it should have been an effortless task to bring together **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** leading men Ben Affleck and Henry Cahill since they had prior experiences donning heroic attire as mighty super-heroes on call to save the day. So why then does Snyder’s big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless?\r\n\r\nThe dour randomness of **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** is quite disappointing because this moping actioner wants to grab more than it can chew in its crowded mouth. Snyder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio aspire to plug in such contemplative issues pertaining to moral ambivalence, political platitudes and religious themes but none of these factors energize or sustain this action-packed narrative that seems to slouch all at the expense of a sluggish approach to the mechanical hedonism that labors.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that **Dawn of Justice** has its share of visual opulence as this is obviously expected in an expansive superhero saga where the proven selling point are two mythical comic book titans spearheading the pumped-up proceedings. Again an overreaching script that plods along, a couple of super-powered sourpusses going the moody motions and the lack of carefree robust action undermine the potential explosiveness that **Dawn of Justice** could have capitalized on with dynamic aplomb.\r\n\r\nSure, there is a noted curiosity and interesting element about the topic of “heroism fatigue” and hidden demons that could have certainly contributed to the psychological strain for our Caped Courageous Ones. Still, **Dawn of Justice** never quite turns this premise into a sparkling case of burn-out conviction, Instead, knuckle-dragging duo of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) and Clark Kent/Superman (Cavell) make the common sleeping pill look like an excitable bag of M&M candy treats. Thankfully, another fan favorite superhero in the form of Wonder Woman (Gal Godot) is thrown into the mix to break up the monotony of the boorish Boys Club. Unfortunately, the appearance of the wily Wonder Woman during the tail end of the second half is too little and too late for her welcomed presence to rescue the film’s clunky pacing.\r\n\r\nGotham’s Bruce Wayne and Metropolis’s Clark Kent are experiencing setbacks that could be perceived as reaching the depressive crossroads. For starters, a maturing Wayne’s/Batman’s crime-fighting prospects have been tailing off drastically. As for Kent/Superman his existence at the Daily Planet newspaper seems mundane especially when his boss in editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) declares that the public has moved away from print given the major impact of social media and other online resources. So yes…Wayne and Kent are in a critical funk in their professional lives both in and out of their familiar costumes. However, can the slumping cities afford two down-and-out superheroes when one can probably carry the load in rough, unsure times?\r\n\r\nWhen the film establishes the dilemma that there can be only one muscle-bound ego to handle the affairs of the region’s unprotected this is where the **Batman v Superman** portion of **Dawn of Justice** looks as if the frenetic fantasy will percolate. Inexplicably, the hype involving the sparring twosome is put on hold as the exposition takes its tedious time building up the conflict to satisfy the clashing insecurities of the capable caped crime-stoppers. For those that witnessed Cavell’s mediocre **Man of Steel** a few years ago will probably understand the current bad blood that exists between the two super studs. Whatever the case both Batman and Superman have pegged each other as brawny bad news ambassadors…something that does not sit well with either struggling superhero as their revered reputations are on the line.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there are other outside forces to consider as the acrimonious overtones continue to flow between the brooding mega-powers. The famed instigator in Superman foe Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is realized as the high-tech billionaire nuisance that has an underlying scheme to eradicate both bickering super powers once and for all but not before Luthor pronounces his take on philosophical tirades. In the meantime, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is on board to profess her undying love and support for her desired dreamboat Superman. Luthor loathing Superman while Lane fantasizing about her strong flashy fly boy. In other words it is business as usual. While Superman is trying to figure out his place in the sun Snyder piles on the bothersome dreamy anxieties that plague the aging Wayne.\r\n\r\n**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** is a jumbled mess. Snyder undertakes a convoluted production and tries to sell it as a sophisticated meeting of the misplaced minds between two embattled entities embroiled in uncertainty and super-sized cynicism. Still, Snyder’s vision is mishandled as he seems to have forgotten one crucial point–simply making an action movie that registers with genuine thrills. One cannot help but stumble upon the pretentiousness and piousness that ruins this boneless blockbuster. The film finally decides to stack on the combinations of boisterous match-ups involving everyone but the kitchen sink but all comes off as frivolously forced. Cavell was never really an enticing Superman ever since he donned the big “S” on his chest back in 2013’s** Man of Steel**. Affleck’s Batman is a little more palatable but the constant scowl (both on his face and on the mask) is too much to digest. One would not mind yelling at the screen for Affleck’s alter ego to lighten up a bit.\r\n\r\nThe supporting players are virtually wasted in this exhausting CGI popcorn pleaser. Eisenberg, normally a trustworthy performer with considerable scope, merely irritates as the punkish techno-magnate Luthor. The always radiant Adams is a wash as the gushing Lois Lane. Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons’s Alfred the butler won’t make anyone forget Micheal Caine’s take on Wayne’s trusty man servant anytime soon. Even the reliably adventurous Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon cannot exuberantly bring to life the menacing presence of Zod.\r\n\r\nHumorless and hackneyed, **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry. As for others, they will wonder what lies ahead in terms of other League of Justice movies that hopefully can muster up more entertaining stimulation than this over-indulgent doomsday dud. Is anyone up for **Wonder Woman vs. Redwing** with an empowering feminine twist?\r\n\r\n**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nCruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozed tangible danger.\r\n\r\nFrom the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.\r\n\r\nThe single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.",
